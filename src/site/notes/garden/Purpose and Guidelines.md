# Max's Digital Garden

This PKM (personal knowledge management) system will collect and do the following for me:

- Reflection and learning journal as a writer and using a PKMS
- A place to curate my portfolio
- Create a playground for new ideas and learning
- Gather my bibliography of writing resources
- Document my personal writing best practice (and cite sources)
- Life updates, reflection, ideas
- Mind mapping, connecting ideas, building bridges I may not have otherwise seen
- Inspiration from within

## How to use this site
There is no intended linear way to browse or read content on this site. You can navigate multiple ways:

* Use the **search bar** to see if there is anything on this site that interests you based on your own keywords.
* Select a **tag** when you see it to browse all pages.
* Start with a **path** from the [[garden/Home\|homepage]]
* Use the **navigation bar** to browse pages divided by level of depth or information source. You can find a description of what each of these sections means on the homepage:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/home/#browse-to-read" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

# Paths

## Browse to read!
My goal for this site is to create non-linear paths of browsing and learning. 

It's not perfect; you'll find a little bit of everything everywhere, but here are some paths through the content if you prefer:

| What         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fragments    | Loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc. fragments are sometimes drafts which become notes or trees. **In my digital garden, fragments are like flowers: ideas that grow when it rains.**                     |
| notes        | Structured pages for each topic/interest including quotes, summaries, and other materials from outside sources. **Notes are like birds and butterflies, ideas that come & go from external locations.** |
| trees        | Synthesis of information - connections between notes & fragments. **Trees are ideas that have taken root and expanded beyond a "fragment."**                                                            |
| #path/career | Related to my career                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| #path/faq    | Lost or don't know where to begin? Start here to see what this is all about.                                                                                                                            |

Thank you for your patience while I get things organized.

## Tools

- Digital garden: Obsidian (content management), GitHub, Netlify (hosting)
- Notes and record keeping: DrawNote, Google drive, are.na, paper journals
	- Seasons bingo journal
	- Hobonichi weekly planner
	- Art journal
- Life tracking: Daylio, Finch, personal budget, Google calendar 
- Life sharing: Neocities sites, Maxwrites, Letterboxd, Storygraph, Canva, MyAlbum, Substack, Pencilbooth, Shapchat (private), are.na
## Content management 

### Obsidian folder structure 
Here is an outline of the folder structure I use in Obsidian:

- Use the **0** (zero) folder for life stuff. this is all private.
- Use the **digital garden** folder for drafts and creating empty pages/ideas.
- Move items to the **garden** when they are ready to publish to the site. (These items may be in progress, publish once you feel no anxiety about sharing a half-formed thought.)
- When anything is updated in or added to the garden folder, modify [[garden/Updates\|Updates]] to describe what was done.
- Once a month or as needed, publish via *Digital Garden* plugin ([plugin website](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)).
#### 0 folder (private)
This stuff will probably never see the public.

Folder structure:

- daily (daily notes)
- health (keep up with meds, personal appointments, etc)
- ideas (all files that are just a brain fart of ideas)
- responsibilities (taking care of my home, car, etc)
- seasons (seasonal based to do, notes, projects, reflection, some may move to the garden)
- templates (my templates for my obsidian setup)
- zenny (taking care of my cat, appointments, blood work results, etc)

this folder is also where I keep 
- my homepage, which loads when I open Obsidian and thanks to the *homepage* plugin I can have a separate one on mobile vs desktop ([plugin website](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage))
- a snippets file which holds my cheat sheet for markdown and other script.
#### digital garden (drafts)
Items that enter the **digital garden**
- add tags below file name
- â€‹the title uses h1 
- other headers use h2, h3 etc.
- if you are adding a previously created file, add created date at the bottom under a horizontal rule

subfolders:

- **notes** are topics
	* birds & butterflies - thoughts from external sources, pieces of my history, things I've learned about this, etc.
* **fragments** - loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc. fragments are sometimes drafts which become notes or trees.
	* 1 per thing
	* flowers - ideas that grow when it rains

#### garden (published)
same folder structure as above, including:
 
* **fragments** - loose notes, thoughts, ideas
* **notes** - topics
	* i try my best to link these to other areas in the garden, but frankly it'll never be a complete and true representation of everything that is linked. I'll review them periodically to add more links where I find them.
* **trees** - ideas have taken root
	* synthesis - connections between notes & fragments, reviews of sources, etc - ideally connecting different things and referencing them like in school.
	- stage of tree growth = how formulated an idea it is vs scratch notes still (like animal crossing)
	- library -  sources (books, podcast episodes, articles, etc)
	* 1 note per book/thing, write quotes and notes 

Items are ready for the **garden** website when:
- you've previewed the note for spacing etc (reading mode)
- you added the publish property to the page
- all sources have proper citing if you know it
- you're ready to share a half baked thought without anxiety 
- the site is not having any deployment issues 
### Grouping 
This describes how content is grouped using tags and Obsidian features. (Obsidian-only items are not available on the website version of the garden.)

- Each main topic page in the notes area gets a # notes/something tag.
	- Subtopics and keywords, format: # topic/something - these might have their own pages, or they might not
- Tag structure 
	- notes/
	- topic/
	- max/
	- path/ (entry points to content)
	- type/ (weeknotes, instructional content, maybe some others to come)

Obsidian only:
- Use bookmarks for stuff I use in everyday life (eg grocery list, to do)
- Use tags as status indicators for quick a quick list of posts (eg, books in progress, currently writing, so I can pull them up easily)

### Templates
Here are the templates I've created for myself in my Obsidian setup.

- Diary entries (insert into notes as needed)
	- Anger diary, therapy survey (part of my self-therapy practice)
	- Book report (questions about a book I just finished)
	- EOY and Decade questions (from [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com))
	- Now (inserts template text for my [[garden/Now\|Now]] page)
- Template pages
	- Book page (uses the *Book Search* plugin to create a page with metadata for a specific book - [plugin website](https://github.com/anpigon/obsidian-book-search-plugin))
	- Seasonal to do (I create one each season, this has the categories set up for me) - [[garden/trees/Living Seasons\|Living Seasons]]
- Formatting help for consistency
	- External link (drops template text in for me to edit)
	- Quote (template text)
- Zine Therapy
	- Survey (I fill this out every other week or so to capture what I'm feeling, thinking, processing, bad habits and patterns, etc.)
	- Pre-zine survey (this helps me collect all my reflection over the last few months and think about it)
