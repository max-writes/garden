# Now (archive)

[[garden/Now\|Now]]

This is my Now archive from when I kept my site on WordPress.

**November 13, 2024, 11:21PM**

I’ve been working diligently on my Neocities site and uploaded the new layout/pages today. There is still a long way to go to get any of my sites where I need them to be. I recently started a new medication that helps with executive functioning so I’m hoping to see more activity on my sites going forward.

Listening to: News Podcasts about the political landscape Trump is inheriting

What I’ve been doing around the site:

- My goals for fall set last time: Add another book to the [Notes](https://www.maxwrites.com/category/notes/) area, finish my draft on using ChatGPT and a static site generator to create a [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) website, complete my writer mission statement draft, and upload more photos. I seem to have fallen out of the habit at the end of 2022.
- Progress: I drafted the ChatGPT/static site generator post, but need to add screenshots. I completed my personal statement which was the prerequisite to complete the writer mission statement, so I’m ready to start that now! I made a goal to add 8 months of photos by the end of fall and I’ve gotten through 4.

What’s going on creatively:

- Working on my solstice/winter/holiday cards. I’m going to include a spooky ghost story zine.
- Otherwise I’ve been engaging in low level creative efforts like coloring pages and doodles because it’s been a hectic few months.

What’s going on at work:

- I’ve been documenting learning technology solutions and tools left and right! It seems like I’m finally settling into the scope of my role as it was discussed 6 months ago. It’s been a lot of fun doing research to discover how things work that had been a mystery for so long.
- As part of my “scope settling” I’m training the Quality Assurance team next week on doing testing in our CMS. I’ve been doing functionality testing for a few years and adding them to the process has been pending for a long time. The hand-off won’t happen immediately but this gets us started with training/shadowing.

Just cleaning up some things and choosing new, more mobile friendly layout for the [Notes](https://www.maxwrites.com/category/notes/) area where I am slowly adding book quotes highlighted in the last 8 years or so. I really loved the previous theme except that the image was way too big and it took up the entire phone screen. You had to scroll down to see any text.

Listening to: Supernatural Season 1 Episode 22

What I’ve been doing around the site:

- I haven’t done much at all since my last update. It’s been a weird couple of weeks!
- My goals for fall: Add another book to the [Notes](https://www.maxwrites.com/category/notes/) area, finish my draft on using ChatGPT and a static site generator to create a [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) website, complete my writer mission statement draft, and upload more photos. I seem to have fallen out of the habit at the end of 2022.

What’s going on creatively:

- I am finalizing my Halloween cards (and envelopes) to send out next month. This year I did low effort decor with markers and stickers, but I also made my own stickers for a personal touch.
- I have been journaling in a small pocket-sized notebook a few times a week. It’s basically turning into a junk journal, but I like the small bursts of inspiration and creativity coming out of it.
- It’s spooky season! I consider home decorating a creative endeavor. I’ve been putting stuff up everywhere.

What’s going on at work:

- Our LMS manager left the company so I’m taking over a project to improve the LMS Continuous Delivery release process. It involves multiple teams and various levels of contribution, documentation, decision-making, and communication. Even though it’s one of the largest interconnected processes I’ve ever improved, it’s easy peasy. I’ve been adjacently part of the process for several years so I know what’s expected of everyone and have already had some ideas for improvement over that time.
- This week I’ve been taking a class to get certified in knowledge management. We’re halfway done today and it’s given me a lot to think about, not only for my company specifically, but for my career overall. It seems I might be shifting from a focus on “writing documentation” to “managing knowledge” (not in my current job, but in my personal/professional focus). It’s exciting to learn things and grow!

**September 1, 2024, 4:00pm**

I have been working on this site since 11am as if it is my job today. Zenny (my calico cat) is unhappy at the lack of attention! She wanted to spend the day sitting on the couch on my lap.

Listening to: a playlist of ambient instrumental post-hardcore

What I’ve been doing around the site:

- Learned how to use the Multiple Themes WordPress plugin to assign various themes/designs across the site depending on category or tag
- Started typing up [book quotes](https://www.maxwrites.com/category/notes/) from my library of read books the last decade (don’t worry, I’m not adding literally every book)
- Started some drafts

What’s going on creatively:

- I got a new diagnosis to process so I’ve been feeling inspired to be creative!
- My [CampSnap](https://www.campsnapphoto.com/collections/camp-snap-screen-free-digital-cameras/products/screen-free-digital-camera-yellow) screenless digital camera is GREAT for travel! I feel like I am paying attention more and finding more inspiration from the world.
- I am still battling a mild social media addiction that keeps me away from being creative, but all this new inspiration will help.

What’s going on at work:

- I am developing a classroom content setup strategy for our client’s winter intersession pilot. An intersession occurs between two semesters so operationally it doesn’t fit within the normal development and delivery timelines each semester. The pilot begins in December, but we have to be set up and ready to go before faculty access in November. I love doing process development and I’m excited to do this one collaboratively with a few people I haven’t had the chance to work with yet. It impacts about 15 courses, so up to 500 students!
- I’ve been mentoring a group of support specialists while they audit the documentation that they use to do their jobs. Their manager and I (and others) wrote most of it over the last decade and the entire document library has been overdue for a [major revision](https://www.maxwrites.com/editing-and-revising/master-guide-revision-steps/). So now I have a team of three who are completing an audit to help me organize what to do with the content so we can prioritize the work. Through this project I hope they’ll learn skills related to:
    - using spreadsheets for assignment tracking: I have a few required columns, but otherwise they can update in whatever way helps them keep track of their own work;
    - planning and prioritization: How to plan a very low priority project amongst much higher priority work and still get it done;
    - content analysis: This particular group has reviewed single guides or content sections within a guide, but never all guides in a folder – each of them has been assigned a platform to review from our top 3 technologies and they must rate content based on relevance/currency, accuracy, and audience; and
    - gaining a general of understanding documentation maintenance and what it entails: I think this helps the team understand the role of keeping the documentation up to date, and why we ask them to contribute to the accuracy of the knowledge (for context, we don’t have a team of writers at my company).

Sitting in the living room on the couch with Zenny loafed next to me. I’ve been editing things around the site as I redefine the purpose behind this. It originally started as a writing portfolio to reflect my professional experience, but I have more motivation to write about my life and experiences. (So now the site will cover both.)

Listening to: Deadpool 2. I’m rewatching a few of the movies tonight.

What I’ve been doing around the site:

- Changed the theme, not sure I like it but we’ll see how it goes
- Updated some content here and there for the new purpose
- Started some drafts

What’s going on creatively:

- I’m writing much more frequently in my journal in “shareable ways” (could become posts)
- I’ve been doing a lot of doodles lately
- I got a “screenless” digital camera – I have to connect to my phone or computer to view the photos and I’ve been having fun with that! Old school.

What’s going on at work:

- We’re well into faculty access for the fall semester, but students don’t have access to courses yet. Due to faculty access, lots of tickets have come in already. I’m researching an issue with the course interface for some fall courses which appears to be caused by knowledge and communication gaps. Looking forward to improving this process with our technical teams so this doesn’t happen again in the future.
- All of our projects restarted in the last few weeks (though we were still on pause well after the original July 5 date). It’s almost a frustrating amount of work but our partner team lost their vendor help, so we’re doing what we can to help.

**June 15, 2024, ~2pm**

Sitting in the living room on the couch while Zenny sleeps in the bedroom (it’s darker in there, there is less noise, and that room tends to be cooler than the living room). Making some improvements around the site that I’ve been neglecting for too long. Reflecting on what I want maxwrites to become now that [I’ve achieved one of my primary career goals](https://www.maxwrites.com/career-updates/i-got-promoted-im-now-a-learning-technology-documentation-specialist/)!

Listening to: Nothing, just the fan and the birds outside

What I’ve been doing around the site:

- Updating some code for accessibility and responsiveness
- Cleaning up the pages
- Updated 404 page
- Writing documentation for site management (for myself)

What’s going on creatively:

- I’ve been working on a website for a zine
- Finally bought all the supplies to make mini Monster Hunter item boxes
- Created a “journal” folder in my Google drive to encourage me to type my thoughts more often
- Started building my Black Cat (DC) MOC Lego but I don’t have the right pieces to continue

What’s going on at work:

- The release team is working on a monthly newsletter that reviews all releases from that month. Immediately, we post a release notes news item on our internal stakeholder site, then we summarize all the releases after the last one is deployed. It’s something new we are trying since our stakeholders are getting too many emails – this one will only go out once a month.
- Almost all of our projects have been paused until at least July 5 (likely longer) to engage in all-hands type of work for fall course readiness. The university has made a lot of huge changes for the upcoming fall semester so they’ve recruited our team and others to assist in getting everything out the door on time. It’s literally the kind of work I was hired to do 10 years ago so it’s been fun to revisit for a little while.
- In the meantime, I am still supporting the LTI tool integrations by creating technical documentation for course builders, faculty, and students. I’m pretty on top of my to do list and balancing everything well. We’re also deploying updates to an internal application that’s on a tight deadline, but I have confidence that testing through the environments will be quick.

Listening to nothing, just the gentle hum of the computer and the creaky house

Reading/learning:  
* _The Rise and Reign of the Mammals_ on audiobook though I don’t like the narrator’s voice so I might abandon it, which is unfortunate because it’s really interesting. It sounds like he’s shouting.  
* _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ [online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I started reading this because ChatGPT recommended it as an intro to python and programming so I can learn how to use genAI to help with things  
* _How to be Multiple_ on ebook, learning all kinds of interesting and fucked up stuff about how the world thinks of twins

Loving lately:  
* Once again I’m feeling the creative motivation return – I guess I feel like I got into a little slump for a bit after the new year started (after my vacation ended and I had to go back to work)  
* My perfect cat  
* I’m loving more aspects of my job again, which is very exciting – that is good news for the burnout I experienced, I think it’s going away. We’ve made a lot of improvements internally & now we’re working on improving everything else.

[a debugging manifesto](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/12/08/a-debugging-manifesto/)  
I love this. I’m going to adapt this idea to troubleshooting and processing tickets and create a little quick guide for my team at work. Some of our team members seem to have it in mind that the purpose of a ticket is to resolve it ASAP. At face value I guess that’s true – you want to take care of the customer and reduce their frustrations – but in order to provide overall amazing _continued_ support, you have to view each ticket as a story. You have to understand the context (how it’s supposed to behave, what went wrong, and the resources that helped you resolve it). This helps you to provide better (and sometimes faster) support in the future. Otherwise, each ticket tends to feel like an isolated event, and you have to start from scratch every time you go to resolve it.

I am at a good place with my career (I think) with lots of experience under the belt, but there is a lack of focus. I feel like I’m facing every direction they need me to face to do the job, but not facing the direction I want to face to focus my career. I used this post and many of the suggestions to help begin the journey of defining my values, which will help me define my goals.

_freewriting is a therapeutic activity for me. it’s like there’s a buildup of emotional sludge in my system, and freewriting helps me open a valve to clear it all out. with the words out of my head, i always feel lighter and better. and when i freewrite in lowercase, there’s not only more output, but it’s more real and honest._
