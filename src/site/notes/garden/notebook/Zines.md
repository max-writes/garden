# Zines 

## About
A zine is a self-published, non-commercial, often homemade publication. They are generally the product of a single person (sometimes a partnership or small group compilation), and usually created with paper supplies, scissors, glue, a photo copier, and staples. Usually a zine is defined by editions of 1,000 or fewer copies, though many authors print less than 500. 

The term 'zine' came from the word magazine. Pronounce it like that. (Like "lean" not "line.")

Zines are part of DIY (do-it-yourself) culture and many people have very specific ideas of what a zine can/cannot be. The concept of zines can be traced to the late 19th/early 20th century, and zines are historically any type of creative expression: art, poetry, activism, fiction, self-reflection, and so on. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) notes:
- The 1920s brought "little magazines" created by a group of Black creatives in the Harlem Renaissance - a literary magazine that allowed them to express freely. 
- In the 1930s-60s, science fiction fanzines made a rise. The term fanzine was coined in 1940 by Russ Chauvenet for his zine, Detours. This genre moved past sci-fi into comics, horror, and board games.
- Punk zines emerged in the 1970s with the subculture along with wider access to copy machines and publishing software. Punk and DIY go hand in hand, so it is no surprised that many activist and music zines came out of this.
- Zine-making continued into the 80s where zine folks began cataloging and reviewing zines, forming networking points for zinesters. 
- In the 90s, the riot grrrl movement welcomed DIY punk in zine-making. These zines generally held a more feminist edge than the zines in the 70s and adopt creative styles from "girl" hobbies like scrapbooking. In the mid-90s, e-zines came on the scene where zines were published on the internet and distributed globally without the constraints of postage/supply costs. The 90s also brought commercial adoption of zines as a "marketing theme" and commodifying the DIY culture for profit.
- Zines still exist in the 2000s but they have been increasingly overshadowed by other forms of digital expression. Zines hold a very strong presence online now whether as distros or webzines and one can find zine communities or libraries via websites more often than street signs. However, you only need to go to one small press exhibition to see that zine-making is alive and well with no plans to stop. And I bet your city (or one close to you) has a yearly zine fest that over-crowds with curious and creative people.

## My experience
I've been into zines since I was a teenager, 13 or 14 sitting on the floor in my bedroom sorting through the ones I got new in the last few months. Blue and red papers with words and images printed on them describing music, containing record store stories, reciting lyrical poetry, and opening my awareness to new styles, contexts, and lives.

I've been making zines since 2011, behind the game but never lacking in ideas. Zines have been an integral medium in my life documentation since my late 20s.

### What is a Zine? Exploring the World of DIY Print Culture

> Unlike magazines, zines do not adhere to a strict publication schedule. They can be one-time projects or ongoing series, published whenever the creator feels inspired or has new content to share. This flexibility allows zine creators to experiment with different formats and themes without pressure to meet commercial expectations.

### Everything You Wanted to Know About  A Zine Fest (but were afraid to ask)
Link: [zineworld.org/zine_fests.html](http://zineworld.org/zine_fests.html)

> Zine fests exist to create a space where people can come together and share this awesome form of print media that can otherwise be hard to find. Even in the age of computers and postal mail service, zine fests bring forth a personal way to obtain zines. Not only can you buy, trade, or learn about zines, but you can connect with the actual zine creator or distro owner.

### I read zines to escape surveillance and clickbait. It's the new teen rebellion

> Zines are accessible, often friendly to the reader and easy and cheap to make. If you have a printer and a spare few hours and some ideas, you can become a zine publisher just like anyone else. The process of zine-making becomes meaningful when you realise how differently people engage with them â€“ readers become more connected to the tactile experience of a booklet, often making for more mindful and considered consumption.
