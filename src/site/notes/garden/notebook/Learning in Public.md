# Learning in Public
In reading about digital gardens and their philosophies, I keep seeing the "learn in public" approach come up, which is something I've been trying to do better with this site. (I am still learning to be consistent with it to get the most value.)

For me, there are a few reasons to learn in public, as scary as it can be to be vulnerable about how much (or little) you know, and to put incomplete thoughts online assigned to your name.

* Learn loudly and without structure
	* Document as you go: "today I learned," notes, book notes, "huh" or "a-ha" moments, etc.
	* This is something I struggle with sometimes, but with my system it's easy to keep structures depending on what I need using tags, links, properties, and so on. 
	* By encouraging myself to publish informal thoughts and partial exploration, it's easy to draft up an update and polish it for the site so I can keep the flows going.
* Emphasis on growth
	* I don't have to wait for everything to be perfect since it will always be in progress. (And it will probably always be a little messy.) It's more of an agile approach which I need to get better at in my professional life too so this is good practice!
	* Because the notes are always a work in progress, it feels more like my learning will always be a work in progress. There's no point where I will know everything and in some ways it's easier to celebrate milestones of growth than it is to "wait until it's done."
* Community education
	* If anyone is in the same spot as I am/was for anything I've written about, my site could offer perspective or instructions in a moment when someone might need it. 
	* When I add a mechanism for feedback my site will fit all the 'learn in public' criteria, inviting corrections and thoughts from others.
* Max's knowledge archive
	* It becomes a network of knowledge nuggets and insights from my experience and learning. 
	* As I review and add to it over time, this helps reinforce memory and deepens my understanding of the topics and how they connect.
