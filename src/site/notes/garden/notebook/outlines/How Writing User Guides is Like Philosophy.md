# How Writing User Guides is Like Philosophy

Subtitle ideas
* Exploring Every Path to Understanding
* How Documents Anticipate Questions Before They're Asked
* User Documentation as a Philosophical Exercise

## I. Introduction: The Unexpected Parallel
- Most people think writing user guides is about listing steps, but it's really about anticipating human action
- Like philosophy, documentation requires considering multiple interpretations, possible objections, and alternative paths to truth (or in this case, successful outcomes)
- Writing good documentation is a philosophical exercise requiring empathy, reasoning, and anticipating counter arguments

> [!quote] Parallels
> "The unexamined life is not worth living." - Socrates | "The unexamined workflow will confuse your users." - Every tech writer, probably
> 
> "Doubt is the origin of wisdom." - René Descartes | "Testing every possible user action is the origin of great documentation."
> 
> "All men by nature desire to know." - Aristotle | "All users by nature desire to understand, not just follow directions."

## II. Shared Foundations: Inquiry and Clarity
- In philosophy, clarity and structure ensure users can act with confidence
- Both disciplines rely on:
	- Defining terminology clearly and avoiding ambiguity
	- Establishing assumptions 
	- Creating a logical flow where one idea leads into the next seamlessly

## III. Anticipate the Counterarguments
- Philosophers ask: What if I’m wrong? What if someone disagrees?
- Writers ask: What if the user tries something different? What if they misunderstand this step?
- Both require considering alternative perspectives
	- Users might take unexpected paths through a workflow
	- Philosophers explore opposing viewpoints to strengthen their reasoning
	- Good documentation, like a strong argument, preempts confusion before it arises


> [!tip]  Debate vs. Documentation
> Both are iterative journeys toward shared understanding: one through logic, the other through usability.
> 
> - Philosophy: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis
> - Documentation: User Goal → Error Path → Resolution
> 
> | Debate | Documentation |
> |:-----|:----|
> | **Premises**: Defined starting assumptions		 | **Prerequisites**: Software, permissions, context |
> | **Thesis**: A central claim or question | **User Goal**: The task or outcome the user wants |
> | **Dialectic Process**: Explore every angle		 | **Review**: Validate every workflow |
> | **Antithesis**: The counterargument | **Error Path**: What happens when it doesn’t go as planned |
> | **Synthesis**: A new understanding that resolves both	 | **Resolution**: A clear, tested path to success |

## IV. Empathy as Logic
- Philosophy often hinges on understanding why people believe what they do
- Documentation hinges on understanding why users behave or think a certain way
- Discuss “user empathy” as parallel to “philosophical empathy”
	- Understanding the human behind the question
	- Designing for frustration, curiosity, or error as much as for success

## V: Every Path, Every Possible Interpretation
- Philosophical debate explores multiple paths to the same conclusion
- Writing user guides means mapping all possible user journeys:
	- Alternative entry points (different menus, different devices)
	- Conditional steps (if X, then Y)
	- Edge cases (exceptions to the rule)
- Show how this mindset creates resilient, inclusive documentation

## VI. Searching for the Why Behind the How
- Philosophy seeks why the world works the way it does
- Documentation should help users understand why a process works, not just how to do it
- When users understand reasoning, not just steps, they become more autonomous, skilled, knowledgeable
- This is where documentation transcends instruction and becomes learning

## VII. The Philosophical Mindset of a Writer
- The best writers question their own assumptions, anticipate the unknown, and refine endlessly.
- Writing a user guide isn’t about giving answers, it’s about asking possible questions first

> "We do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience." - John Dewey | "We do not write great docs from first drafts... we write them by reflecting on how users actually experience them."

> "The only thing I know is that I know nothing." - Socrates | "The only thing I know is that users will always surprise me."
> 
> "You cannot step into the same river twice." - Heraclitus | "You cannot step into the same document twice - you always return armed with new knowledge."
> 
> "He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that." - John Stuart Mill | "They who test only one user path knows little of the full workflow."
> 
> "The measure of intelligence is the ability to change." - Albert Einstein | "The measure of good documentation is the ability to adapt when your product or users do."
> 
> "Truth springs from argument among friends." - David Hume | "Clarity springs from review among teammates."
> 
> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit." - Aristotle | "Those who do not document past issues are condemned to rediscover them."
> 
> "The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it." - Niccolò Machiavellia | "The more versions a system has gone through, the clearer our documentation should become."
