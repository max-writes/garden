#path/faq

# MaxWrites.com
Welcome to my site! This is a digital garden which means it's a mostly flat file system containing my thoughts, knowledge, notes, ideas, and connections.

It's not perfect; you'll find a little bit of everything everywhere, but here are some paths through the content:

* *fragments*: Loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc. fragments are sometimes drafts which become notes or trees. **In my digital garden, fragments are like flowers: ideas that grow when it rains.**
* *notes*: Quotes, summaries, and other materials from outside sources. **Notes are like birds and butterflies, ideas that come & go from external locations.**
* *trees*: Synthesis of information - connections between notes & fragments. **Trees are ideas that have taken root and expanded beyond a "fragment."**
* #path/career : Posts related to my career

Thank you for your patience while I get things organized.

This site uses [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), [Nelify](http://netlify.com), and [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

I used [Wanderloots](https://wanderloots.xyz/)' ["How I Published My Obsidian Notes Website For Free" YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8e5IiUkeo) to get everything working. It took 3 months to establish my Obsidian knowledge flow and 50 minutes to learn how to publish the site.

This site is *always* a work in progress.
