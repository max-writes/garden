TIL you can add your personal M365 calendar to a SharePoint sites page using the M365 calendar web part. I think it probably pulls for the user, so it's more like a personal dashboard/homepage helper?

There is no way to show the events from the "Events" feature on SharePoint in a calendar view. You get the usual content views (filmstrip, grid). I have always known there was no way to do the events as a calendar but I thought maybe they updated it. And they did! To let you show your personal M365 calendar.
