# Writer Mission Statement 

## Writer Mission Statement 8/8/24

I write to provide others with foundational knowledge of processes and platforms involved in their work so that they can link concepts faster than they might have independently, and so guide users have a shared knowledge source for best practices and how-to information.

**Core Values**

- Integrity
- Accuracy
- User-centered
- Consistency (styling, formatting, voice)
- Knowledge sharing

I like writing everything! I have opportunities to write different types of documents in my current position, but my favorite writing is focused on software instructions and process that a non-technical person might require to complete their job duties. This often includes:

1. how the technology is supposed to work towards their individual goals/use cases,
2. the intersection between operations and technical process (what is a technical limitation vs business decision),
3. instructions for using customizations, and
4. guidance via troubleshooting scenarios.
