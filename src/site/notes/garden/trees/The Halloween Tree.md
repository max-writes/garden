# The Halloween Tree

## My review

This is a book I keep putting aside for other books that I prioritized during the official Halloween season. For a while I read _Frankenstein_ every year, then I did _Dracula_, then I moved onto [[garden/trees/The Ghost - A Cultural History\|The Ghost - A Cultural History]], which took a few seasons to get through. One year I read another of Ray Bradbury’s books, _October Country_, which quickly became a favorite.

This year I wanted to do something fun and since I’ve been trying audiobooks lately, I decided to find _The Halloween Tree_ on audio and listen to it at the end of September.

Before I purchase audiobooks I always listen to a little bit of the sample (not too much) to make sure I can stand the cadence and pitch (?) of the narrator. I am sensitive to certain sounds and I can deal with this in everyday life, but I try not to spend money on and subject myself to it in my free time.

_The Halloween Tree_

When I did this, I guess the bit I reviewed was part of the narration, because I did not expect it to be a full dramatization including multiple voice actors, sound effects, and singing. I somehow [missed the part that says full cast](https://play.google.com/store/audiobooks/details?id=AQAAAADJqRipwM) in the description (I admit: I don’t always read the description because I don’t want to be accidentally spoiled). I don’t know that I will listen to this version again, but I like having it as a backup and it’s uniquely special as the first time I heard this story.

_The Halloween Tree_ is a wonderful Halloween tale that’s spooky, cute, funny, magical, and educational – a perfect kick-off to October. I am looking forward to finding a different version of it for next year, or reading the book I have on hand. I’ve also found out [there’s a film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191173/) to watch, so it looks like I’ve found a new Halloween tradition to tack onto my existing ones.
