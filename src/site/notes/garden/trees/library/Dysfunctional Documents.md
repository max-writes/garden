## My review

## Notes while reading
12 step doc program
- obviously written for teams with more than one writer or with writers and editors and managers who all care about the writing
- I was still able to take some information to apply to my situation and laid out a plan to review the docs for local/global issues and update the style guide
- some insight into how I can improve my processes to be more collaborative (I was the main writer for 5 or so years, but now new hires are starting to contribute more)
- I could write a book, after reading I felt more inspired to outline a potential tome about my experiences and recommendations from being the sole writer on a team
- reflection on how the book was applied to come.
