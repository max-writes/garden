# The Little Book of Hygge

## My review

_from my journal_  
Writing to to sound of a crackling fireplace, I’m in bed, back propped up by pillows, reflecting on the book I just read. I finally took some time to read because I wanted to finish one of my _many_ in-progress books before diving into a book about wintering. (It’s Feb 21 and felt important to at least _start_ the winter book during winter.) The Hygge book only had a few pages left and now here we are visiting this journal and writing some words.

Reading this book, I couldn’t help but think of my friend Megan who has such a cozy, comfy home designed to bring her joy and relaxation. I have been striving to achieve that feeling in my home since I moved into my current place almost four years ago, but I’m slow. It takes me a long time to buy frames and hang art, and it’s taken me even longer to finish unpacking. (Four years and not unpacked???) At this point it’s just mess – stuff in boxes that isn’t organized, most of which I can probably get rid of. Not very hygge.

Some very hygge stuff I already have/do:

- I have TONS of blankets – a blanket for every chair/couch/bed so I can be perfectly cozy everywhere without having to get up and steal blankets from my other spots (this also means there are plenty of options for guests)
- I like low lighting; rather than using overhead ceiling lamps, I use table and floor lamps. Many of them have lights that trigger multiple levels (low lighting, medium lighting, white lights). I basically only use the ceiling lights when I clean.
- Like blankets – tons of pillows. TONS. When Halloweentime comes around I scour the shops for pillows I can keep out all year and have a lovely collection of spooky pillows to keep me cozy.
- I like candles… I wouldn’t say I burn them all that often though. This area needed improvement and you’ll see it again below.
- I’ve got string lights everywhere! At some point during the depths of 2020 pandemic I decided to say fuck it and got a bunch of different fun string lights for multiple areas of my home. There are still other places I can hang them. I love them.
- I frequently have hot cocoa – sometimes I see it as a dessert, but most of the time it’s just a nice warm, cozy treat at the end of a long day, cuddled up in blankets and enjoying the silence of the night.
- Speaking of… I’ve always been attracted to and fascinated by silence. I read a book called _Silence in the Age of Noise_ by Erling Kagge a few years ago because I am a quiet, slow person who doesn’t make much noise. Since then I’ve been very appreciative of everything silence brings and means.
- I’ve been building seasonal practices and routines that help me feel closer to the movements of nature and the circular patterns of life.
- I’m not sure the book specifically mentioned this one, but I write letters and postcards. I think that’s VERY hygge, especially since they foster connection and gratitude.
- I have books in every room because of the quote “a room without books is like a body without a soul,” but it has ended up fitting this hygge theme too. The presence of books is comforting to me and looking at them, touching them as I pass, picking up one to flip through – all of these things and more bring me simple joy.

Some hygge stuff I adopted or embraced because of this book:

- I got some LED candles because my candle work needed improvement. I don’t burn candles very often because of the fire hazard made worse by having a hand tremor so I asked Megan about her candles and now I have a bunch.
- Related to letters and postcards – I try to send something fun for Valentine’s Day to my besties and this year I specifically included a line for each person about how awesome and cool they are, or why I’m grateful to have them in my life. I got a lot of positive feedback; everyone was happy to get a personalized message from the heart.
- I have a lot of wooden furniture and wood items at home. It’s become part of my style to mix these antique browns and tans in with my otherwise bright colors (reds, purples, greens). Before reading this book I was unsure about this and thought maybe I should replace those items, but not anymore! I can see how these pieces bring a kind of neutrality and mediate the other colors. I don’t see much of a contrast anymore – it all fits together.
- When I was younger I hated wearing sweaters because they were itchy, or the fabrics on the sweaters I was wearing were uncomfortable in some other way. I swore off sweaters (preferring sweats instead) because of this. But sweaters are so cozy and lovely! I managed to try on some sweaters recently and realized (kind of silly I didn’t think of this before) that sweaters come in all kinds of materials, some of which are not itchy at all and in fact the most comfortable thing ever. Now I have LOTS of sweaters, some of which are my favorite clothes, and gaining more!
- As I mentioned above – I am quiet! I am slow! I love silence and have always enjoyed smaller, simpler joys over huge limited time ones. Reading this book helped so much with embracing this side of myself. I’ve been feeling weird about loving “coziness” over “fashion/style” my whole life because cozy usually doesn’t look as pretty as whatever’s hip. I’ll be out with friends wearing the coziest outfit ever while they’re dressed to conquer the world. I’m ready to give up that self-consciousness (and sometimes guilt) loving these calm, peaceful, and comfy things more than the average bear. If this is part of my identity, so be it! (It doesn’t mean I don’t dress up, of course, but I tend not to unless there’s a dress code.)

It’s winter right now so it’s already a hygge season. I’m looking forward to seeing how I can put some of the other stuff I read in practice later in the year – especially summer, when I have the least amount of fun because as someone extra sensitive to heat, it’s way too damn hot to find comfort.

title: The Little Book of Hygge : Danish Secrets to Happy Living
author: [Meik Wiking]
category: [Self-Help]

description: New York Times Bestseller Embrace Hygge (pronounced hoo-ga) and become happier with this definitive guide to the Danish philosophy of comfort, togetherness, and well-being. Why are Danes the happiest people in the world? The answer, says Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, is Hygge. Loosely translated, Hygge—pronounced Hoo-ga—is a sense of comfort, togetherness, and well-being. "Hygge is about an atmosphere and an experience," Wiking explains. "It is about being with the people we love. A feeling of home. A feeling that we are safe." Hygge is the sensation you get when you’re cuddled up on a sofa, in cozy socks under a soft throw, during a storm. It’s that feeling when you’re sharing comfort food and easy conversation with loved ones at a candlelit table. It is the warmth of morning light shining just right on a crisp blue-sky day. The Little Book of Hygge introduces you to this cornerstone of Danish life, and offers advice and ideas on incorporating it into your own life, such as: Get comfy. Take a break. Be here now. Turn off the phones. Turn down the lights. Bring out the candles. Build relationships. Spend time with your tribe. Give yourself a break from the demands of healthy living. Cake is most definitely Hygge. Live life today, like there is no coffee tomorrow. From picking the right lighting to organizing a Hygge get-together to dressing hygge, Wiking shows you how to experience more joy and contentment the Danish way.
