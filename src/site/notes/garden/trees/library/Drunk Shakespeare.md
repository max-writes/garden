# Drunk Shakespeare 

It’s the season for hangouts which means I was too busy to go to ANY other pride event in June. I have a severe lack of [[digital garden/fragments/queer\|queer]] and LGBTQ+ folks in my friend group. (It’s also a season for [[digital garden/fragments/hot hot heat\|hot hot heat]], so I didn’t want to go out much anyway.)

Drunk Shakespeare has a different cast for every performance, with a different person getting drunk. They prep by taking shots, then continue to drink throughout the night/performance, while a handful of other actors from the group support with props, direction, and (of course) acting various roles. The group has 10 people with 5 performing a different [[digital garden/fragments/Shakespeare\|Shakespeare]] play each night. There’s an element of audience improv to make a unique experience – my ghost purse was used as a dagger prop at one point!

We had the privilege of seeing drunk Macbeth on a “pride night” performance with trans and non-binary cast members. It was EASY to develop a crush on every one of them, though I’ll say the person playing Macbeth stole my heart so swiftly that when they asked for my purse, I froze and blushed like a teenager. It was very exciting and fun! Would attend again.
