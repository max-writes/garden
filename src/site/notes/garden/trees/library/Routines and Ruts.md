# Routines and Ruts

In May I wrote my thoughts after finishing the book _I Didn’t Do the Thing Today: Letting Go of Productivity Guilt_ by Madeleine Dore which I recommend to anyone neurodivergent or who just can’t seem to “stick” to things the way they expect themselves to. (I think those two general categories probably cover everyone.)

I recommended the [Routines and Ruts podcast](https://extraordinaryroutines.com/podcast) which I recently finished completely. However, it can be difficult jumping into a brand new podcast without any guidance – especially one with several seasons to get through.

I kept track of my favorite episodes and the ones that were most helpful for refreshing my perspective so I could listen to them again. I thought it would be helpful to offer the list here for those who don’t want to jump in blindly.

**Season 1**

- Episode 5: Ryder Carroll on intention over productivity
- Episode 9: Oliver Burkeman on embracing limitations, stale goals, and unclenching from routine
- Episode 17: Kylie Lewis on finding new routines, self-compassion, and collective vulnerability
- Episode 19: Creativity in a pandemic: There is no one way
- Episode 20: Matthew Evans on creative lessons from farming and cooking
- Episode 21: Ingrid Fetell Lee on how to find joy right where you are

**Season 2**

- Episode 5: Kemi Nekvapil on defining your own relationship to routine and diminishing self-judgment
- Episode 7: Sarah Wilson on showing up, going to your edge, and living an enlarged life
- Episode 8: R&R mini: On indecision and the fear of better options
- Episode 10: R&R mini: On letting go and how to survey your ‘shoulds’
- Episode 12: R&R mini: On allowing for distraction
- Episode 13: Kylie Maslen on invisible illness, boundaries, and shared understanding
- Episode 18: R&R mini: On ‘puddle theory’ and how to do things you’re putting off
