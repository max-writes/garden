# The Halloween Tree
by Ray Bradbury
## Summary
Make storytime a little spookier with fantasy master Ray Bradbury as he takes readers on a riveting trip though space and time to discover the true origins of Halloween. Join the shadowy Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud as he takes eight trick-or-treaters on an unforgettable journey to find their missing friend, Pip. Travel through space and time, from the tombs of ancient Egypt to the gargoyles of Notre-Dame Cathedral, all the way to the cemeteries of Mexico on el Día de Los Muertos, the Day of the Dead. Is Pip still alive? And if so, can his friends save him from a ghastly fate before it’s too late? 
## My review

This is a book I keep putting aside for other books that I prioritized during the official Halloween season. For a while I read _Frankenstein_ every year, then I did _Dracula_, then I moved onto [[garden/fragments/library/The Ghost - A Cultural History\|The Ghost - A Cultural History]], which took a few seasons to get through. One year I read another of Ray Bradbury’s books, _October Country_, which quickly became a favorite.

This year I wanted to do something fun and since I’ve been trying audiobooks lately, I decided to find _The Halloween Tree_ on audio and listen to it at the end of September.

Before I purchase audiobooks I always listen to a little bit of the sample (not too much) to make sure I can stand the cadence and pitch (?) of the narrator. I am sensitive to certain sounds and I can deal with this in everyday life, but I try not to spend money on and subject myself to it in my free time.

When I did this, I guess the bit I reviewed was part of the narration, because I did not expect it to be a full dramatization including multiple voice actors, sound effects, and singing. I somehow [missed the part that says full cast](https://play.google.com/store/audiobooks/details?id=AQAAAADJqRipwM) in the description (I admit: I don’t always read the description because I don’t want to be accidentally spoiled). I don’t know that I will listen to this version again, but I like having it as a backup and it’s uniquely special as the first time I heard this story.

_The Halloween Tree_ is a wonderful Halloween tale that’s spooky, cute, funny, magical, and educational – a perfect kick-off to October. I am looking forward to finding a different version of it for next year, or reading the book I have on hand. I’ve also found out [there’s a film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0191173/) to watch, so it looks like I’ve found a new Halloween tradition to tack onto my existing ones.
