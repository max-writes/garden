# 2016 in e-learning

Books to read for a snapshot of 2016 in online education

_Managing Technology in Higher Education_ was published in 2011 and _Learning with E’s_ in 2015. I read them in 2016. These would be a good set of books to provide a snapshot into the “current” technology and “upcoming” strategies at that moment. This was the hype before institutions got rapidly online due to COVID-19 lockdowns.

Both review many of the foundational concepts of using technology in online higher education, without requiring you to read the entire history and theory of online education. They contextualize and explain what you need to know to understand the timeline of teaching and learning online.

_Managing Technology in Higher Education_ provides case study examples of technology implementations in higher education institutions. Read this and gain operational knowledge and lessons learned from companies that have leveraged various technologies in higher education.

_Learning with E’s_ dives into experiential examples of technology tool implementations in classrooms and learning programs. Gain perspective on the considerations and risks faculty and course designers should note when requiring students to adopt new technology as part of their learning journey.

**Learn what to contextualize in your decisions so you don’t make easy mistakes. Start on the shoulders of knowledge that has been shared already.**
