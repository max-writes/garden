# Site Updates
This page includes major updates only (significant new content, new pages, deleted pages). 

The date is when I uploaded the batch, not necessarily when I made the change. Each page has a time stamp for created and updated if you're that curious!

## May 11, 2025
~~Oh rad, I am having deployment issues.~~ hello, please be proud of me, I fixed my first deployment issue!
- Added: **The Body Keeps the Score**, **Book and Dagger**, **Horror Movies**, **Journal Systems**

- Housekeeping
	- Moved some pages from Trees to Fragments because they aren't quite complete thoughts yet 
	- Moved many pages from Notes to Fragments to make it clearer to myself what pages need more work (damn, it's almost all of them)
	- Cleaned up my tags 
	- Added some book quotes to some of the book pages and linked them in topic pages
	- **Cemetery List** is my test for images with captions, fingers crossed. If it looks good after publishing I'll start updating the rest of my pages with images to match.
		- TIL I can't put quotes in the caption. Also the nice captions and formatting don't show up online at all! Womp womp.

_Hey, Max, I read all the way to the bottom of your updates page. Can you reward me by answering a question? Why didn't you link any of these pages?_

Forgive me, I didn't want this page to come up as a reference on every page on the site ü§∑üôèü´∂
