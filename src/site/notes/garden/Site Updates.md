# Site Updates
This page includes major updates only (significant new content, new pages, deleted pages). The date is when I uploaded the batch, not necessarily when I made the change. Each page has a time stamp for created and updated if you're that curious!

## Next update
- Added: **My Approach to Learning Digital Accessibility** and a way to contact me.
- Added back from the old garden: **Overheard**, **10 Things that Shape My Reality**, **Tips for Grads**
	- These were in my digital garden before I redid it. Doing some digital organizing and archiving so I can clear some space on my phone when things sync.
	- Overheard: I keep wanting to write stuff down, but have nowhere to put them. Now I will have somewhere to share them.

## Oct 27, 2025
- Added: **LinkedIn Posts**, **How Writing User Guides is Like Philosophy**
- Updated: **Building a Living Knowledge System for Technical Support Teams**, **Home**, **Zines**

## Oct 12, 2025
- I overhauled the whole website, took out all the personal stuff (it was a lot), and stripped it down to career-related pages only. That is the actual purpose of this site, but my digital garden method brought me down a whole different path! I will still be maintaining my garden elsewhere, but I want to be able to put this site on my resume as an example of professional and personal writing (mostly professional).
