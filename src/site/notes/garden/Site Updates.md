# Site Updates
This page includes major updates only (significant new content, new pages, deleted pages). The date is when I uploaded the batch, not necessarily when I made the change. Each page has a time stamp for created and updated if you're that curious!

## Oct 12, 2025
- I overhauled the whole website, took out all the personal stuff (it was a lot), and stripped it down to career-related pages only. That is the actual purpose of this site, but my digital garden method brought me down a whole different path! I will still be maintaining my garden elsewhere, but I want to be able to put this site on my resume as an example of professional and personal writing (mostly professional).
