Hi, I'm Max and this is where I write about documentation and knowledge management. 

**Purpose:** [[garden/notebook/Learning in Public\|Learning in public]] through my [[garden/notebook/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] helps me document and share my evolving thoughts, get over perfectionism, and build a personal knowledge archive that grows with me. My goal for this site is to create non-linear paths of browsing and learning. 

**Disclaimer:** Proceed knowing that I write about a lot of stuff and I know I could be wrong! When I talk about my life and events I try to bring it back a few steps to generalize the experience, but if I've misrepresented anything concerning, please let me know and I'll correct it.

This site uses [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), [Nelify](http://netlify.com), and [GitHub](https://github.com/). I used [Wanderloots](https://wanderloots.xyz/)' ["How I Published My Obsidian Notes Website For Free" YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8e5IiUkeo) to get everything working. It took 3 months to establish my Obsidian knowledge flow and 50 minutes to learn how to publish the site.
