# Hello!
Welcome to my site! This is a [[garden/notes/Digital Gardens\|digital garden]] which means it's a mostly flat file system containing my thoughts, knowledge, notes, ideas, and connections. I am already having anxiety about learning in public.
## Browse to read!
My goal for this site is to create non-linear paths of browsing and learning. 

It's not perfect; you'll find a little bit of everything everywhere, but here are some paths through the content if you prefer:

| What         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fragments    | Loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc. fragments are sometimes drafts which become notes or trees. **In my digital garden, fragments are like flowers: ideas that grow when it rains.**                     |
| notes        | Structured pages for each topic/interest including quotes, summaries, and other materials from outside sources. **Notes are like birds and butterflies, ideas that come & go from external locations.** |
| trees        | Synthesis of information - connections between notes & fragments. **Trees are ideas that have taken root and expanded beyond a "fragment."**                                                            |
| #path/career | Related to my career                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| #path/faq    | Lost or don't know where to begin? Start here to see what this is all about.                                                                                                                            |

Thank you for your patience while I get things organized.

## How it's made
This site uses [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), [Nelify](http://netlify.com), and [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

I used [Wanderloots](https://wanderloots.xyz/)' ["How I Published My Obsidian Notes Website For Free" YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8e5IiUkeo) to get everything working. It took 3 months to establish my Obsidian knowledge flow and 50 minutes to learn how to publish the site.
### In progress

This site is *always* a work in progress.

To do 
- [ ] Improve image and video syncing & embedding (it's ugly) - in progress
	- [ ] Can I display images with a max size, but if they're smaller they are small? They're all needlessly huge.
- [ ] How to get dataview plugin stuff to publish to site?
- [ ] Move quotes from draft garden to online pages 
- [ ] Type quotes from physical books
- [ ] Create genre/author tags for books after adding more - there are beginning to be lots of repeats
- [ ] Can I use a customized "page not found" template (I tried, it broke my site)

**Completed**
- [x] Why does this to do list look so weird on the site? ✅ 2025-03-08 (It was the layout I chose)
- [x] Mobile view - add padding somehow? I like this theme but I don't like that it runs without margins in mobile ✅ 2025-03-08 (also the theme)
- [x] Folder structure is not publishing properly ✅ 2025-02-01 (I fixed this by updating the path rewrite rules in the Digital Garden plugin - basically, I didn't really fix the issue but updating my navigation bar got rid of it)
- [x] Review published files for issues (e.g., hashtags that are actually the pound sign being used as the word "number" are converted to a tag, womp womp) ✅ 2025-02-20
- [x] Check all links - some unpublished pages are linked (I've decided this is ok - those are future published pages) ✅ 2025-02-20
- [x] Clean up book pages metadata template ✅ 2025-03-19
	- [x] Remove created/updated dates ✅ 2025-03-18
	- [x] Reorder/add formatting ✅ 2025-03-18
	- [x] Prettify descriptions ✅ 2025-03-19
	- [x] Add a header for easier navigation and better structure ✅ 2025-03-18
	- [x] Move the tags to the top of the doc for consistency across site ✅ 2025-03-18
	- [x] Fix existing book files to match new template ✅ 2025-03-19
