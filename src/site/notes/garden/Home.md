#path/faq

# Hello!
Welcome to my site! This is a digital garden which means it's a mostly flat file system containing my thoughts, knowledge, notes, ideas, and connections. Unlike most sites you may be used to, there's no information architecture and you won't find structural navigation.

## Browse to read!
My goal for this site is to create non-linear paths of browsing and learning. I write about my experiences, what I'm reading/watching, things I've learned, creative projects, etc. 

It's not perfect; you'll find a little bit of everything everywhere, but here are some paths through the content if you prefer:

| What         | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fragments    | Loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc. fragments are sometimes drafts which become notes or trees. **In my digital garden, fragments are like flowers: ideas that grow when it rains.** |
| notes        | Quotes, summaries, and other materials from outside sources. **Notes are like birds and butterflies, ideas that come & go from external locations.**                                |
| trees        | Synthesis of information - connections between notes & fragments. **Trees are ideas that have taken root and expanded beyond a "fragment."**                                        |
| #path/career | Related to my career                                                                                                                                                                |
| #path/faq    | Lost or don't know where to begin? Start here to see what this is all about.                                                                                                        |

Thank you for your patience while I get things organized.

### How it's made
This site uses [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), the [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), [Nelify](http://netlify.com), and [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

I used [Wanderloots](https://wanderloots.xyz/)' ["How I Published My Obsidian Notes Website For Free" YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f8e5IiUkeo) to get everything working. It took 3 months to establish my Obsidian knowledge flow and 50 minutes to learn how to publish the site.
### In progress

This site is *always* a work in progress.

To do
- [ ] Improve image and video syncing & embedding (it's ugly)
- [ ] Review published files for issues (e.g., hashtags that are actually the pound sign being used as the word "number" are converted to a tag, womp womp)
- [ ] Check all links - some unpublished pages are linked
- [ ] Can I use a customized "page not found" template 
- [ ] How to get dataview plugin stuff to publish to site?

- [ ] Clean up book pages metadata template & fix existing files
	- [ ] Remove created/updated dates
	- [ ] Reorder/add formatting
	- [ ] Prettify descriptions
	- [ ] Genre/author pages
	- [ ] Add a header for easier navigation and better structure
	- [ ] Move the tags to the top of the doc for consistency across site

- [ ] Mobile view - add padding somehow? I like this theme but I don't like that it runs without margins in mobile 
- [x] Folder structure is not publishing properly âœ… 2025-02-01 (I fixed this by updating the path rewrite rules in the Digital Garden plugin - basically, I didn't really fix the issue but updating my navigation bar got rid of it)
