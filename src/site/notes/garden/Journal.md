# Journal
There are a few journals I keep around this site, in addition to the one below. I find it easier to keep track of my thoughts and patterns if they're categorized and kept within certain contexts, so I'll use tags to keep track of those thoughts in one spot even though they may not be written in 1 place.

If you're interested in the rest, find them under:
- #diary-bingo : Progress and reflection on my [[garden/trees/Living Seasons#bingo\|seasonal BINGO]] cards
- #diary-camping : Entries about camping

I've added two new pieces from Horrornaments (2018 and 2021 but new to me) to my little haunted house display. 

I want to build a little graveyard and the nola crypt gives me a place to start.

it's relatively tiny, I mean the skeleton person breaking out is probably a small teenager given the size of other things but whatever, my haunted house display doesn't need to scale exactly.

I got the skull flower because I've been obsessed with skull sunflowers and this is the first I've seen that stands up on its own so I can add it to the collection of weird plants in the yard.

I took some Legos out of my bins and stacked them in various ways.

I have an idea to make a little thing for a website but it's very difficult to build an idea with Lego bricks if you don't have every option you're thinking of. Like I know certain pieces exist because I've used them before but I don't know which sets or numbers or even really how to describe them.

I am excited to be playing with Legos again, though.

This is my home. (It'll probably change once I dig out more bricks.)

My tentative plan is to make a micro version of the larger Lego mountain town I want to do, not an exact replica but something similar enough that I could potentially use it as a draft for the larger build.
