# Max's Digital Garden purpose and guidelines 

*Updated: 1/16/25*

This PKM system will collect and do the following for me:

- Reflection and learning journal as a writer and using a PKMS
- A place to curate my portfolio
- Create a playground for new ideas and learning
- Gather my bibliography of writing resources
- Document my personal writing best practice (and cite sources)
- Life updates, reflection, ideas
- Mind mapping, connecting ideas, building bridges I may not have otherwise seen
- Inspiration from within

## Tools

- Digital garden: Obsidian, GitHub
- Notes and record keeping: DrawNote, Google drive, are.na, paper journals
- Life tracking: Daylio, Finch, personal budget, Google calendar 
- Life sharing: Neocities sites, digital garden, Letterboxd, Storygraph, MyAlbum
## Content management 

### Obsidian folder structure 
- Use the **0** (zero) folder for life stuff. this is all private.
- Use the **digital garden** folder for drafts and creating empty pages/ideas.
- Move items to the **garden** when they are ready to publish to the site (may be in progress). Once a month, publish via *enveloppe* plugin.
- in these folders, use the folder idea outlined below under each heading 

#### 0 folder (private)
This stuff will probably never see the public.

Folder structure:
- daily (daily notes)
- health (keep up with meds, personal appointments, etc)
- ideas (all files that are just a brain fart of ideas)
- projects (personal and home project tracking and reflection, some may move to garden)
- responsibilities (taking care of my home, car, etc)
- seasons (seasonal based to do, notes, projects, reflection, some may move to the garden)
- templates (my templates for my obsidian setup)
- zenny (taking care of my cat, appointments, blood work results, etc)

this folder is also where I keep 
- my homepage, which loads when I open Obsidian and thanks to the *homepage* plugin I can have a separate one on mobile vs desktop.
- a snippets file which holds my cheat sheet for markdown and other script.

#### digital garden (drafts)
Items that enter the **digital garden**
- â€‹the title uses h1 
- last updated date below that
- add tags below date
- other headers use h2, h3 etc.
- add created date at the bottom under a horizontal rule
- ideally, the file uses an alphanumeric title with hyphens instead of spaces (filename), but not required.

subfolders:
- **notes** from sources (books, podcast episodes, articles, etc)
	* 1 per book/thing, write quotes and notes (see [template](obsidian://open?vault=MPKM&file=0%2Ftemplates%2Fbook%20page) which uses book search plugin)
	* birds & butterflies - thoughts from external sources
* **fragments** - loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc. fragments are sometimes drafts which become notes or trees.
	* 1 per thing
	* flowers - ideas that grow when it rains

#### garden (published)
same folder structure as above, including:
- synthesis - connections between notes & fragments, reviews of sources, etc - ideally connecting different things and referencing them like in school.
	* **trees** - ideas have taken root
	- stage of tree growth = how formulated an idea it is vs scratch notes still
	- (like animal crossing)

Items are ready for the **garden** website when:
- the file uses an alphanumeric title with hyphens instead of spaces (filename)
- you've previewed the note for spacing etc 
- you added the share property to the page
- all sources have proper citing if you know it
- you're ready to share a half baked thought without anxiety 
- you have QA'd the filename 
- the site is not having any deployment issues 
### Grouping 
- use tags to index keywords or search terms based on topics that interest me, format: #topic / something 
- use tags as status indicators for quick a quick list of posts (eg, books in progress, currently writing, so I can pull them up easily)
- tag structure 
	- topic/
	- help/map, FAQ, glossary
	- max/
	- path/ (entry points to content)
- use bookmarks for stuff I use in everyday life (eg grocery list, to do)
