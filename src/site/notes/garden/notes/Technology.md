## Quotes
from _Managing Technology in Higher Education: Strategies for Transforming Teaching and Learning_ by A. W. (Tony) Bates, Albert Sangra (published in 2011)

> Priority for technology infrastructure projects should be related to meeting functional objectives, such as more interactive student services, improved learning outcomes, or reducing operational costs, and thus should be determined as part of an integrated planning process, not just because they are the latest technology trend or even because of strong demand from one or two powerful pressure groups.

from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> Technologies are neutral, and the potential threads reside in society rather than in the technology itself.
---
> Further evolution of technologies and increased reliance upon their use in human activities may advance society into completely new, unexpected and unpredictable directions.
---
> Siva Vaidhyanathan is uncomfortable with the erroneous misclassification of generations and associated assumptions of technology competency levels, and warns: ‘We should drop our simplistic attachments to generations so we can generate an accurate and subtle account of the needs of young people–and all people, for that matter.’

### Data and privacy
from *Defriending the Web* by Dennis Knopf (published in 2009)

> this data gathering is more explicit with Blockbuster’s replacements like netflix, where customers fill their preferences into user profiles so as to have movies suggested to them. a great service, and all you have to do is to provide detailed information about who you are and what you like. even greater is your service to them; their market research isn’t just free, you even pay for participating in it.
