## Quotes

### In praise of knowledge
from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> Knowledge is like love. You can give it away as much as you like, but you never lose it.

### Knowledge vs...
from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> Being able to regurgitate surface knowledge onto a test paper to gain as high a grade as possible is as far removed from education as it is possible to be. Exams are at best a snapshot of students’ memories at the time the test is administered. The exam itself tells us nothing about how children will cope with the messy, complex problems they will face in real life, or how good they are, for example, at working in a team.

### Knowledge work
from _Managing Technology in Higher Education: Strategies for Transforming Teaching and Learning_ by A. W. (Tony) Bates, Albert Sangra (published in 2011)

> Workers in knowledge-based industries need to continue to learn throughout life, to keep up to date in their fields and indeed to develop new knowledge that can be applied to their work.
> 
> Workers in such industries are expected to have the following:
> 
> - Good communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening)
> - Ability to learn independently
> - Social skills (ethics, positive attitudes, responsibility)
> - Teamwork
> - Ability to adapt to changing circumstances
> - Thinking skills (problem solving; critical, logical, and numerical thinking)
>- Knowledge navigation (where to get information and how to process it)
---
> Knowledge-based companies depend on innovation–creating, modifying, and improving products and services–rather than reproducing the same product all the time, as in an industrial organization.
> 
> Information and communications technologies can be thought of as the raw materials of a knowledge-based economy, in that they provide the means for creating, storing, analyzing, transferring, reproducing, and transforming information.
> 
> Because new knowledge is being created so fast, it is impossible for someone to cover everything within a particular area of study such as engineering or medicine. Therefore the focus must be on the management of information: how to find, analyze, organize, and apply information appropriately.
