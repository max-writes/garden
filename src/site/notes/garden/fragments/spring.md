## Diary

### First camping trip of the season 4/28/25
#diary-camping #diary-bingo 
**Where**: Big Bone Lick State Park in Kentucky, [Photo Album](https://myalbum.com/album/R3RKqj5EEEivFd/?invite=b677bb18-dda0-40a2-8721-14a1badb5b8e) 

This eliminates the third square of my Spring BINGO page, I am not going to get a BINGO yet but I still have many opportunities and (almost) two full months to get there.

I spent a lot of April either sick or off routine for some other reason and it's also been above 80 for a lot of days so I haven't done a lot of my fun springtime plans. I did, however, build Lego flowers (see entry somewhere below) engage in cherry blossom festivities (Sakura Matsuri), and made a [cherry blossom coloring page](https://zinetherapy.neocities.org/library/spring-cherryblossoms.png).
### Spring refresh 4/19/25
I'm thinking a lot about change and how changes impact the flow of your life and trying to remind and convince myself that I don't need to spend lots of money or impulsively change everything in order to feel something new. 

instead I've been thinking of ways I can change up my routines seasonally so I feel shifts and movements more frequently. I want to catch the energy the season brings, instead of trying to push against it. 

spring. 

what is a spring refresh? what does that mean?

- build Lego flowers (early in the season)
- noticing dust / dirt more because the sun is at a different angle between earth things and time change things
- therefore, upping the cleaning game
- playing with zenny more daily
- bigger change happens several weeks into spring, before that I had to close out winter and be sucked into a void for a few weeks.
- get rid of winter stuff, take down winter decor
- more pollen, more particles, bugs, etc
- refresh home smells
- do laundry / wash all blankets and things
- dye your hair
- cut your hair?
- take down the rest of last year's halloween decor - the year is resetting
- bring in more cat furniture and things for Zenny to do and enjoy
- rearrange around the home, refresh the way you use things
- read more about nature and humans being connected to the world

- the weekend before camping for the first time - clean up the house, clean up the car, get ready for camping season

incredible, no notes.

I also liked this combination to start the dandelion flower and how it came together like nuts and bolts.

some other favorites:

these are really important to making all kinds of interesting flowers:

I went to Bricks and Minifigs today for the first time even though when I was on Instagram I followed them before they opened. just haven't been out there yet. 

![20250322_144727~2.jpg](/img/user/garden/fragments/attachments/20250322_144727~2.jpg)

it was a very nice day and they had a lot to look at, built sets and "new sets" (some were old) and custom sets and custom builds, community builds on display, a ton of minifigures (some trapped inside bubbles floating in buckets, all facing random directions unsure of their fate), and buckets full of Legos for purchase but I didn't want to get carried away.  they had lots of other stuff including individual flowers from various botanical and flower and plant options, some I think (?) in alternate colors. so cool. so I bought three of those.

I also had the Field Flowers 30701 set from an earlier eBay purchase which I made today too. After I made them all I combined them and they are now the flowers next to me when I sit in this room.

It's a small thing but I suck at keeping plants alive so it's lovely to have some color and add flowers to a room even if they are fake.

The green Aster (from Flower Bouquet 10280 but green instead of purple) was missing an incredibly integral piece of the build (Brick 6223219, which you can see above in the flower pieces I pointed out) but I had an extra one, no big deal. I think I am finally where I want to be with my Lego collection where I can start being more creative with it. Of the three that I bought at the store today, this was my favorite to build.

My Welsh Poppy is from Wildflower Bouquet 10313 and it was a very good first build to warm up my hands, being incredibly quick and simple. I love Brick 6420922 (pictured above, the first in this entry). It is part of a flower but it is also a snowflake. It could also be mexican bu√±uelos made with a fine tip. A small ferris wheel. Like many Lego sets, this came with an extra piece. 

I wasn't paying attention and didn't see that I bought the closed flower from Lotus Flowers 40647 but that's okay, I think I like the small pop of pink in my spring flowers better than a larger bloom. Other than not having to keep plants alive, it's also nice to have flowers in a single stage perpetually. For the aesthetic.
