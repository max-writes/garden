incredible, no notes.

I also liked this combination to start the dandelion flower and how it came together like nuts and bolts.

some other favorites:

these are really important to making all kinds of interesting flowers:

I went to Bricks and Minifigs today for the first time even though when I was on Instagram I followed them before they opened. just haven't been out there yet.

it was a very nice day and they had a lot to look at, built sets and "new sets" (some were old) and custom sets and custom builds, community builds on display, a ton of minifigures (some trapped inside bubbles floating in buckets, all facing random directions unsure of their fate), and buckets full of Legos for purchase but I didn't want to get carried away.  they had lots of other stuff including individual flowers from various botanical and flower and plant options, some I think (?) in alternate colors. so cool. so I bought three of those.

I also had the Field Flowers 30701 set from an earlier eBay purchase which I made today too. After I made them all I combined them and they are now the flowers next to me when I sit in this room.

It's a small thing but I suck at keeping plants alive so it's lovely to have some color and add flowers to a room even if they are fake.

The green Aster (from Flower Bouquet 10280 but green instead of purple) was missing an incredibly integral piece of the build (Brick 6223219, which you can see above in the flower pieces I pointed out) but I had an extra one, no big deal. I think I am finally where I want to be with my Lego collection where I can start being more creative with it. Of the three that I bought at the store today, this was my favorite to build.

My Welsh Poppy is from Wildflower Bouquet 10313 and it was a very good first build to warm up my hands, being incredibly quick and simple. I love Brick 6420922 (pictured above, the first in this entry). It is part of a flower but it is also a snowflake. It could also be mexican bu√±uelos made with a fine tip. A small ferris wheel. Like many Lego sets, this came with an extra piece. 

I wasn't paying attention and didn't see that I bought the closed flower from Lotus Flowers 40647 but that's okay, I think I like the small pop of pink in my spring flowers better than a larger bloom. Other than not having to keep plants alive, it's also nice to have flowers in a single stage perpetually. For the aesthetic.

Mid-Aster build enjoying the flow.
