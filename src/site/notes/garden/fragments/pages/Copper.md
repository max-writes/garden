## Origin & Location

The word copper is a corrupted form of a Latin word that meant ‚Äúmetal of Cyprus," referring to Roman copper mining on the island of Cyprus. The modern name for the element first came into use around 1530.

- **Primary source(s):**  
  - Chile: Especially in the Atacama Desert region (e.g., Chuquicamata and Escondida mines)  
  - Peru: Southern highlands (e.g., Las Bambas, Cerro Verde)

- **Geological context:**  
  Found in porphyry copper deposits, formed by hydrothermal fluids in igneous rock intrusions, particularly along tectonic plate boundaries of the Andes.

## Uses
Uses may be industrial, cultural, nutritional, etc.

- Used in:
  - Wiring and cabling (electricity and telecom)
  - Electric vehicle motors and wind turbines
  - Plumbing, roofing, coins, and industrial machinery

- Global demand drivers:
  - Surge in green tech and electrification
  - Construction in emerging markets
  - Digital infrastructure (data centers, 5G)
  
- Essential for human nutrition

## üó∫Ô∏è Story of Discovery & Exploitation

- **Initial discovery:**  
  Indigenous peoples of South America, including the Moche and Inca, used native copper for tools and ornamentation as early as 500 BCE.

- **Colonial/modern extraction:**  
  Spanish colonizers initially focused on gold and silver, but copper became significant in the 19th and 20th centuries. During the 20th century, U.S. and British companies dominated Chile‚Äôs mines.

- **Modern situation:**  
  In 1971, Chile nationalized its copper mines (e.g., CODELCO), which remains state-owned, but foreign companies still dominate parts of the supply chain. Peru has seen violent conflicts over mining expansion on Indigenous land, particularly in the Andean highlands.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Extraction Requirements

- **Mining method(s):**
  - Open-pit mining (Chuquicamata is one of the world‚Äôs largest)
  - Underground mining (less common)
  - Smelting and acid leaching (produces toxic waste)

- **Environmental cost:**
  - Massive water use in arid regions
  - Acid mine drainage contaminates rivers
  - Tailings ponds threaten ecosystems and communities

- **Human cost:**
  - Displacement of indigenous communities
  - Labor exploitation and union crackdowns
  - Heavy metal exposure for nearby residents and miners
