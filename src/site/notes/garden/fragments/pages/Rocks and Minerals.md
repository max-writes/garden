# Rocks and Minerals Fact Sheets

This page contains a list of major rocks and minerals from South America, and some facts about them from my readings and studies.

- [[garden/fragments/pages/Lithium\|Lithium]]

## Notes and sources 
Each page contains a section at the bottom with some sources for the specific information. Here is a list of sources that I used for all pages.

- *Open Veins of Latin America* by Eduardo Galeano
	- This book is what got me interested in mapping out all the minerals. It's where I got some of the gory details about origins and human cost of extracting these materials.
