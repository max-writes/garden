# Noodles
## Ramen

Ramen is not gluten free, so when I have ramen I need to get special gluten free ramen, which is usually just a block of gluten free rice noodles and miso for the base. I don’t get the fancy ramen flavors unless I want to pay more or use products that have a lot of unnecessary packaging.

Because of this, I have gotten to play with the soup base a little - no flavor packets to influence what I’m doing. 

Here are some combos I’ve enjoyed (no measurements - measure with your soul, but I’ve written the ingredients from most to least amount), keeping in mind this is in addition to miso. Although these taste fine with water, I usually use soup broth (chicken or veggie works), or half water/broth, depending on what I have available in the kitchen.

- Soy sauce, sriracha
- Soy sauce, vanilla extract, Thai peanut sauce (especially good if you add eggs + salt)

## Mac & Cheese
Make the mac & cheese like you normally would. After mixing in cheese/etc, try one of these options: 
- add soy sauce, mix
- Add a small amount of very spicy green salsa (to preference), salt & pepper, mix
- Add chili lime seasoning & mix to taste (i like to mix then add a little more and mix lightly so that some of the bites have more chili lime BURST than others)
- Meat mixins: chicken, ham
- Veggie mixins: something that will add color
- Added cheeses: ricotta balls

Sides for Mac & cheese
- apples or pears (for texture) - any will do but some are better than others.
- Asian pear is kind of not sweet enough but it’s nice how juicy it is
