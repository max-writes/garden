what I like about Chicago:
- easy to navigate whether you're walking or taking public transportation 
- there are skylines everywhere since it's relatively flat

- lots of parks and trails
- lots of art everywhere 
- lake Michigan 
- there are beaches
- Olivia lives there
- polar bears
- that's where I realized that cemeteries have stories, not just the people taking up space there
