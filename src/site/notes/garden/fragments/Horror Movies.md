# Horror Movies
I have seen a LOT of horror. When I was a kid I was drawn to the creature features because they were so cool (and often misunderstood - samesies), but I couldn't handle the graphics and gore. I had intense nightmares and an active imagination that sometimes made daytime scary too so as a form of self-care I stopped watching horror in the theaters. I was only watching it during the day for a while, but eventually stopped that too. 

Fast forward to the mid-2010s when I revisited some journals that revealed my child/teenhood love of horror, something I had forgotten about. It had been so long since the last time I watched a horror and didn't keep my eyes closed the whole time. Out of curiosity and to connect to that younger version of myself, I started making a list of horror movies and series that I loved as a child. It took a while to construct the list because I was doing it from memory or based on quick mentions and references in my journal where, apparently, I did not think to write the name of the movie I was referencing. 

I remembered being scared by some things, specifically:
- A woman getting shot during sex
- Someone getting stabbed by knives from under the bed (I confirmed this was not a Freddy movie though)
- Sci fi horror - futuristic jail with floating robots as guards
This list was longer but that was over 10 years ago. I am sure I could dig it up somewhere. You get the idea: I had snippets of memories of scenes that scared me, and that's what I was building the horror list from.

I'm going to update this for better filtering, viewing, but just getting this page started for now.

This page doesn't only include typically low-rated movies, but it does include a lot of them and I don't differentiate. My ratings are based on my personal feelings, whether I liked a movie or not, not based on critical reception.
