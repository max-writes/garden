### Summer and I are enemies! 6/25/25
#diary-bingo 

Summer bingo is going to be a stretch so I put a lot of stuff on here that I would have probably done anyway. Here in the first week we are already in a heatwave and I am DYING. I haven't had A/C in a while and it was bearable until June hit, and then only got increasingly intolerable.

The bingo activity has been a lot of fun in defining what each season means to me, and the many activities I enjoy doing (though perhaps not every year). Summer is the 4th bingo card I've done and I'll be excited to give a review after a year.
