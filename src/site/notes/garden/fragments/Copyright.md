### Best practices


## My experiences/history
I was hired at a university in 2014 to assist with an Open Educational Resources (OER) initiative to move all textbooks and learning resources not just online, but hosted within the university's content management system. I didn't become an expert in copyright but I learned a lot and I want to expand that knowledge!
