# Social media

## Notes and half-thoughts

- what do the algorithms do on each of the sites, especially the ones I use but not all of them 
- every time something happens with one of the social medias, everybody has all kinds of commentary about every other site all the sudden. it's very exciting. 
- I am having a social media break for all of winter but as the TikTok ban looms, I'm giving myself a TikTok weekend. I haven't been on since December and everybody's hair is longer.

social media algorithms are manipulating human behavior

- they decide what you read and watch
- unregulated
- learns what you want - changes the person into someone who's more predictable
- trying to get more clicks, that's it's goal, so it shows you gateways into other things
- more extreme = higher emotional response to content that affirms your views of the world - gets them riled up about what they're riled up about
- human propagandists know this - but they can only produce one message at a time
- algorithm can produce one stream for each human, specially tailored to them
- knows how you engage in every piece of content 
- no evidence of how algorithms work - platforms are opaque. even the company boards have no access to data
- govt trying to fix the fact that no one has access to any of the data - policy recommendations, agreements between govt/platforms for transparency (aggregated data)
- reinforcement learning algorithms - maximize long term sum of rewards (eg clicks). these will manipulate you and try to change your brain.
- supervised learning algorithms - trying to get it right right now, predict whether you're going to click on an item (eg, recommend based on likes). wouldn't cause you to change what you like. 
- effects of different algorithms?
- if they are manipulating people that's a problem!
- creators think like the algorithm - end up creating a lot of clickbait
