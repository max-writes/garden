# Knowledge Capture Flows
As this system evolves I want to capture how I am intaking knowledge.

## After trainings, courses, or other large investments into knowledge
Pilots: [[digital garden/fragments/library/Knowledge Management Certification\|Knowledge Management Certification]], [[garden/fragments/library/Accessibility Trainings\|Accessibility Trainings]]
1. While I'm taking a course or engaging in something, I take notes. Sometimes that's directly in Obsidian but most of the time it's in a journal or on a scrap of paper because I couldn't find a journal.
	- For my KM cert, I started a new journal just for this sort of thing and thankfully I found it before the accessibility trainings began.
2. Write an "immediate" page in the PKMS (timing would depend on the training or how it's delivered and whatever else is going on in my life) where I type out my notes, thoughts, and questions for percolation and review later. 
	- Since I didn't have this system when I got my KM cert I don't have that part, but I do have notes so I'm going to substitute it with typing out each day's notes in different sessions and taking a moment to think about it before I take a break.
	- The accessibility trainings were 3-hour sessions and there were a few each week, so I typed up my notes on the weekends.
3. Make action items and track outcomes of short-term goals that thoughtfully use my new knowledge to help solidify it. 
	- I unofficially did that with the KM cert - I didn't keep track of them, but I used the knowledge in small ways at work, which I will try to outline to set up for the next step.
	- For the accessibility trainings I'm going to make a list of items to change in my writing for work vs hobby and websites and then keep track of the updates and where I made them.
4. I will wait 6+ months and do some synthesis. A retro review of my goals, how I applied the knowledge, and what worked/didn't work. Review my notes from the event, the notes captured in PKMS, booklets and resources/materials or videos provided by the sponsor, and all the things. This may take a few weeks. Take notes, add to notes, link notes, create new goals and ideas for application. Wrap new points that I didn't catch before into my context and understanding of this topic.
	- For the KM cert I'll be jumping into this step after the last step is done. I'm at this point now, but pretend-starting from scratch to support the new workflow.
	- I'll hit this for the accessibility trainings in Nov 2025. 

I don't know what happens after that but it seems to be a good workflow idea so far.

## Capturing my website making knowledge 
I've noticed that in my new 'era' of web design there is one major difference between how I used to design sites in 1998-2006, and how I do it now (2023+).

In the past, I would learn how to structure things, then recycle and build upon my own code and previous layouts. Using this method, I eventually learned the structural language and between my sites and random internet searches, I was able to build a general understanding of how HTML and CSS work to the point where I could code from scratch. For context, this may have been necessary due to lack of resources, and I was generally building the same kinds of sites (heavy on writing/information and therefore providing a more focused blog-like layout).

Now, I look online and search Neocities/indeweb sites almost every time I start a new design. All of my ideas are very different so I feel like I have to find a tutorial to build it from scratch every time. Because I'm constantly using different resources when making sites, I'm not giving myself the space to learn over time how the structure works or building a general understanding of HTML, CSS, responsive design, etc. There are so many different ways to achieve the same goal that I find myself reading different approaches each time. 

Since the approach is different, I'm not sure I can expect myself to learn the same way. I'm trying to think of ways to capture and store the knowledge so that I can self-reference and stay consistent. I'm sure I can use the PKMS system for that, but how?

- learn things for site, build site, etc
- after I'm done: 
	- take out code snippets for features/etc and put on the structure or styling page (html files in maxcrunch KB)
	- what does it do/example
	- how to configure/update it
- this will help build a database of stuff I've learned - eventually I imagine I'll expand on it and improve over time.

This note originally began as a Daily Note (6/8/25).

## MKPM intake and processing
collecting knowledge in obsidian 

### Seeding
intake (as things arise)

Mobile or desktop 
- adding notes or idea lists as things come up
- if a note/topic doesn't exist already then I use daily note for quick access
- this week or week notes types of files
- ideas, to do lists, etc.
- finch
	- add goals to remind myself to update this - every other Tuesday add to spring season journal (desktop editing)

desktop 
- go over last few dailies and make pages in the offline garden for them (to be expanded upon and added to garden)

### Watering
promoting growth (when I'm bored)

mobile or desktop 
- dedicated time spent to review and add to a note or two in the offline garden (it may only be 1, no pressure)

desktop 
- page by page image maintenance, update mobile mistakes, organize contents

### Blooming
flourishing (when I'm motivated)

desktop 
- dedicated time spent to review and add to a note or two in the offline garden (it may only be 1, no pressure)
- facilitate workflow from offline to online garden 
	- pages tagged and organized appropriately
	- grammar checks
- dedicated time spent to review and add to notes in the online garden 
	- expand and provide thoughtful analysis 

### Pruning 
refining and management (infrequent)

mobile or desktop 
- a near constant awareness of improvements required to the workflow, and remembering to document them

desktop 
- once a year, dedicated time spent to review and modify or archive notes in the online garden 
- once a year, dedicated time spent to review items in the archive for awareness
- once a season, overall site maintenance and keeping process and tool details up to date
