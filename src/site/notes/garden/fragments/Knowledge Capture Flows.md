# Knowledge Capture Flows
As this system evolves I want to capture how I am intaking knowledge.

## After trainings, courses, or other large investments into knowledge
Pilots: [[digital garden/fragments/library/Knowledge Management Certification\|Knowledge Management Certification]], [[digital garden/fragments/library/Accessibility Trainings\|Accessibility Trainings]]
1. While I'm taking a course or engaging in something, I take notes. Sometimes that's directly in Obsidian but most of the time it's in a journal or on a scrap of paper because I couldn't find a journal.
	- For my KM cert, I started a new journal just for this sort of thing and thankfully I found it before the accessibility trainings began.
2. Write an "immediate" page in the PKMS (timing would depend on the training or how it's delivered and whatever else is going on in my life) where I type out my notes, thoughts, and questions for percolation and review later. 
	- Since I didn't have this system when I got my KM cert I don't have that part, but I do have notes so I'm going to substitute it with typing out each day's notes in different sessions and taking a moment to think about it before I take a break.
	- The accessibility trainings were 3-hour sessions and there were a few each week, so I typed up my notes on the weekends.
3. Make action items and track outcomes of short-term goals that thoughtfully use my new knowledge to help solidify it. 
	- I unofficially did that with the KM cert - I didn't keep track of them, but I used the knowledge in small ways at work, which I will try to outline to set up for the next step.
	- For the accessibility trainings I'm going to make a list of items to change in my writing for work vs hobby and websites and then keep track of the updates and where I made them.
4. I will wait 6+ months and do some synthesis. A retro review of my goals, how I applied the knowledge, and what worked/didn't work. Review my notes from the event, the notes captured in PKMS, booklets and resources/materials or videos provided by the sponsor, and all the things. This may take a few weeks. Take notes, add to notes, link notes, create new goals and ideas for application. Wrap new points that I didn't catch before into my context and understanding of this topic.
	- For the KM cert I'll be jumping into this step after the last step is done. I'm at this point now, but pretend-starting from scratch to support the new workflow.
	- I'll hit this for the accessibility trainings in Nov 2025. 

I don't know what happens after that but it seems to be a good workflow idea so far.
