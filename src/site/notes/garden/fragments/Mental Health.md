## Quotes

> There is a very good answer to the question "What if I can't?": just do it, because there's no other choice. How do you meet the challenge that you have been given? If you do nothing, you will remain stuck, but if you take a step forward, that will be the start of your own path.
> 
> from RyoJun Shionuma, chief priest, Jigenji temple 
> "Life is Half Good, Half Bad. How Will You Live?"
