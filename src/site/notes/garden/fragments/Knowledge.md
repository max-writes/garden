### Knowledge
> Raw intelligence has little value without experts who can make meaning of the intelligence. (Page 33)

> SIS even refused to share most of its institutional knowledge with the SOE, convinced that SOE agents would get captured and give everything away. No matter. The SOE would start with the traditions it could—and would build its own institutional knowledge from there. (Page 61)

> In the 1970s, the anthropologist Clifford Geertz would use bazaars as a model for understanding environments filled with unreliable information: “To start with a dictum: in the bazaar, information is poor, scarce, maldistributed, inefficiently communicated, and intensely valued.” (Page 81)

> the goal of counterintelligence is to use the enemy’s intelligence services to your advantage, which means you should let those services keep running. The task isn’t to cut off information, but rather to control it (Page 96)

> Journalists, for instance, often use the phrase “too good to check” to refer to stories that nobody wants to fact-check because they’re so fun to believe that people actively fight for them over the truth (Page 287)

> A human expert’s knowledge is valuable partly because the expert knows the limits of that knowledge. Decades later, Kent wrote to a friend that no new technologies would put that thesis out of date—not computers or microdot messages or clandestine listening devices: “The heart of the book is as solid as ever; the game still swings on the educated, thoughtful man, not on gadgetry.” (Page 349)

### In praise of knowledge
from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> Knowledge is like love. You can give it away as much as you like, but you never lose it.

### Knowledge vs...
from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> Being able to regurgitate surface knowledge onto a test paper to gain as high a grade as possible is as far removed from education as it is possible to be. Exams are at best a snapshot of students’ memories at the time the test is administered. The exam itself tells us nothing about how children will cope with the messy, complex problems they will face in real life, or how good they are, for example, at working in a team.

### Knowledge work
from _Managing Technology in Higher Education: Strategies for Transforming Teaching and Learning_ by A. W. (Tony) Bates, Albert Sangra (published in 2011)

> Workers in knowledge-based industries need to continue to learn throughout life, to keep up to date in their fields and indeed to develop new knowledge that can be applied to their work.
> 
> Workers in such industries are expected to have the following:
> 
> - Good communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening)
> - Ability to learn independently
> - Social skills (ethics, positive attitudes, responsibility)
> - Teamwork
> - Ability to adapt to changing circumstances
> - Thinking skills (problem solving; critical, logical, and numerical thinking)
>- Knowledge navigation (where to get information and how to process it)
---
> Knowledge-based companies depend on innovation–creating, modifying, and improving products and services–rather than reproducing the same product all the time, as in an industrial organization.
> 
> Information and communications technologies can be thought of as the raw materials of a knowledge-based economy, in that they provide the means for creating, storing, analyzing, transferring, reproducing, and transforming information.
> 
> Because new knowledge is being created so fast, it is impossible for someone to cover everything within a particular area of study such as engineering or medicine. Therefore the focus must be on the management of information: how to find, analyze, organize, and apply information appropriately.

### What Does a Knowledge Ops Manager Do?
Link: [blog.screensteps.com/knowledge-ops-manager-role](https://blog.screensteps.com/knowledge-ops-manager-role)

> When it comes to the person in charge of managing your company's knowledge, I prefer the role of Knowledge Operations Manager to that of Technical Writer.
> 
> Both roles create documentation. But, while Technical Writers focus on formatting and output, Knowledge Ops Managers focus on empowerment, performance, and outcomes.

> You need at least one full-time person to lead KM, but a small team can be better than a large one, and KM should report to a neutral organization such as Operations.
