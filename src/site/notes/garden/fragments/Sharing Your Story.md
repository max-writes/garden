# Sharing your story

why is it good to share your story/experience?

what has stories?
- tattoos - invitation to share my story
- scars
- the shape of your body
- physical ailments
- chronic pain
- your relationship with things - your reader story, writing story, gender, love stories, friendship stories, etc.

what tells stories?
- national story
- global story
- family story/generational stories
- your online presence
- how you are at work

telling stories is essentially human.

things people shouldn't share? why? 

when to allow things to unfold vs share experience as you go?

the power of perspective - reading other stories provides new questions to people
check in, creates a feedback loop with myself, think more deeply

sharing your story unprompted is an invitation to build community. sharing your story "anonymously" (sorta) where people can land on it and find it is creating little connections here and there, sometimes unknown to the author. your story could anger and shame someone unintentionally, or it could validate, comfort, help, guide, or make someone feel seen for the first time in their life.

many stories I've found online have made me feel this way. in the last 20+ years I've lost track of the connections, but the stories have stayed with me.

that's why I share mine. I need to write (it's the best tool I have for processing information) and I want to share. 

writing helps me understand what I think about it and how 

all of us are here for the first time.

build empathy by reading others stories
