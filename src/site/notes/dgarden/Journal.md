# Journal
There are a few journals I keep around this site, in addition to the one below. I find it easier to keep track of my thoughts and patterns if they're categorized and kept within certain contexts, so I'll use tags to keep track of those thoughts in one spot even though they may not be written in 1 place.

If you're interested in the rest, find them under:
- seasonal reflection tags

## August 16, 2025
I am officially on vacation!! Every year I take a week off for my birthday. I wanted to take a moment to write about how I'm feeling/doing overall since I've been doing a lot of hobby-based journaling lately and sort of ignoring my thoughts and feelings.

Recently my company got word that we're closing and getting integrated into the university where we provide support. I'm not that worried because I am taking the process seriously, but it's still incredibly anxiety-inducing. Overall, I recognize the last few weeks/months have been upsetting and it's been a lot to get through.

I did it though! Okay, we're not through it yet... but I updated my resume, LinkedIn, and made a cover letter, completing prep for the first milestone in the process: applying for my job. That happens next week.

It's nice to take a minute to relax. Even though my vacation has started and I won't be in office next week, it still feels like this is the "weekend" to that week I just had, rushing to finish all my work and finalize my resume within 40 hours. (Don't worry, we got the go-ahead to work on that at work.) To decompress and share, I made this page with my process: [[dgarden/fragments/Update Your Resume\|Update Your Resume]] 

Outside of that I've been cleaning my home, declogging pipes, without A/C, taking nature walks, cuddling with Zenny, watching stuff, and building websites. I'm making a Halloween site and a site to display my postage, not for any particular reason other than I want to be able to stare at my collection wherever I am. I am hoping to have the Halloween site done by Halloween, but we'll see how that goes. 

2025 so far has been weird and not great in a lot of ways, but I'm glad I set up all these little journal and note systems because they are keeping me afloat really well. Things are falling out of my brain more often lately but Obsidian is here to catch them and remind me later.

I've added two new pieces from Horrornaments (2018 and 2021 but new to me) to my little haunted house display. 

I want to build a little graveyard and the nola crypt gives me a place to start.

it's relatively tiny, I mean the skeleton person breaking out is probably a small teenager given the size of other things but whatever, my haunted house display doesn't need to scale exactly.

I got the skull flower because I've been obsessed with skull sunflowers and this is the first I've seen that stands up on its own so I can add it to the collection of weird plants in the yard.

I took some Legos out of my bins and stacked them in various ways.

I have an idea to make a little thing for a website but it's very difficult to build an idea with Lego bricks if you don't have every option you're thinking of. Like I know certain pieces exist because I've used them before but I don't know which sets or numbers or even really how to describe them.

I am excited to be playing with Legos again, though.

This is my home. (It'll probably change once I dig out more bricks.)

My tentative plan is to make a micro version of the larger Lego mountain town I want to do, not an exact replica but something similar enough that I could potentially use it as a draft for the larger build.
