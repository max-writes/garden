History/timeline

### Summer
- **Astronomical season:** 20 June - 22 Sept, 2025
- **Meteorological season:** 1 June - 31 Aug

Summer is the warmest and brightest season of the year. In the northern hemisphere, summer starts in June, while in the southern hemisphere it begins in December. 

At or around summer solstice, daylight hours are the longest of the year, with day length decreasing as the season progresses. Near solstice you'll catch the earliest sunrises and latest sunsets. Before August ends, you are already noticing that the darkness descends earlier.

In addition to being a season, the word 'summer' is used to describe years of someone's age ("during my summer years") or the general concept of staying somewhere for a summer ("summering").

Midsummer is a celebration of the season of summer and takes place on or near summer solstice; in European tradition is the middle of summer, which starts in May and ends on the first of September. Midsummer is traditionally celebrated with bonfires and feasting among friends and community. In US cultural tradition, summer begins on Memorial Day, the last weekend of May, and ends on Labor Day on 1 September. If you're in school, summer lasts from the end of last term to the beginning of next term.

Holidays in the US include Juneteenth (19 June) and Independence Day (4 July). If you only get federal holidays and have limited PTO, summer is an especially long season at work. Honorable mention: Canada Day is July 1!!
