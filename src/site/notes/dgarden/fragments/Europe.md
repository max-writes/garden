I am using this to learn more about European history, but I'm also using this to learn more accurate history from different perspectives. For example, from a non-white perspective, the "Age of Exploration" was an age of invasion, genocide, slavery, and resource extraction. 

The Industrial Revolution depended on slavery and unpaid labor. Europe’s "progress" was inseparable from colonial destruction.

Sciences, medicines, and philosophies were often suppressed, stolen, or repackaged as European "discoveries." 

Instead of progress and Western dominance, world history is about continuity, survival, cultural memory, and resistance. These are the threads I want to pick up and share with you on this page.
