# US President Fact Sheets

This page contains a list of US presidents and some facts about them from my readings and studies.

- [[dgarden/fragments/pages/01-George Washington\|01-George Washington]]

## Notes and sources 
Each page contains a section at the bottom with some sources for the specific information. Here is a list of sources that I used for all pages.

- *A People's History of the United States* by Howard Zinn
	- This book is what got me interested in learning more about the presidents. I didn't get much from here but still wanted to note where the catalyst came from.
