## Origin & Location

- **Primary source(s):**  
  - Bolivia: Salar de Uyuni  
  - Chile: Salar de Atacama  
  - Argentina: Salinas Grandes, Hombre Muerto  

- **Geological context:**  
  Found in salt flats (salars) where lithium-rich brine lies beneath the surface. These form in high-altitude basins in arid zones, where volcanic minerals weather into groundwater and get trapped.

## Uses
Uses may be industrial, cultural, nutritional, etc.

- Used in:
  - Lithium-ion batteries (phones, laptops, EVs)
  - Energy storage systems for renewables (solar/wind)
  - Aerospace alloys, medications (e.g., bipolar disorder treatment)

- Global demand drivers:
  - Surging electric vehicle and solar/wind adoption
  - Push for net-zero carbon economies
  - Strategic mineral classification by USA, EU, China

## üó∫Ô∏è Story of Discovery & Exploitation

- **Initial discovery:**  
  Indigenous communities in the Andes have known the salars for centuries, but Western interest surged in the 20th century. Scientific identification of lithium-rich brines began around the 1970s.

- **Colonial/modern extraction:**  
  Unlike silver or gold, lithium wasn‚Äôt extracted during colonization. But modern extractivism is neo-colonial: foreign companies (especially U.S., Australian, Chinese) dominate operations and profits. 

- **Modern situation:**  
  - In Bolivia, state-owned YLB has struggled with foreign partnerships and infrastructure.  
  - Chile allows private firms like SQM and Albemarle to mine under tight regulation.  
  - Argentina has opened its lithium to massive foreign investment, often bypassing Indigenous consent.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Extraction Requirements

- **Mining method(s):**
  - Brine extraction: drill wells, pump saltwater to evaporation pools, isolate lithium over months

- **Environmental cost:**
  - Evaporation mining uses 2 million liters of water per ton of lithium
  - Causes aquifer depletion in already dry regions
  - Alters ecosystems critical to flamingos and traditional agriculture

- **Human cost:**
  - Indigenous resistance ignored or suppressed
  - Lack of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)
  - Little to no economic return for local communities
