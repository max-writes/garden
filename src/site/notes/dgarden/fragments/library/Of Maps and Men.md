# Of Maps and Men : The Mysterious Discovery of Antarctica

## Summary
This story begins with Dr. Weihaupt's explorations in the deep unexplored interior of Antarctica and the questions they inspired. Today we have a good understanding of the nature of our planet and its human history, yet there are inevitably more questions about who and what we are than there are answers. We know so little about our human past. When we get them, the answers are astonishing. The Ice Ages call into question far more recent history, the world of splendid ships, hearty mariners, intrepid explorers, breathtaking courage, and imaginative cartographers. What we witness in this book is the examinations of glaciers and ice sheets that lead to fascinating mysteries of human Medieval and Renaissance times. These mysteries include the discovery of Antarctica. The first to sight that continent, as recorded in history books, were scruffy whalers of colorful lore. However, there is another side to this story hidden deep in the Ice Age scientific record. Ancient maps are at the heart of this inquiry. If you enjoy maps, you will enjoy the adventure that unfolds. If not, your time is better spent in less adventurous pursuits. If you read this book, you will find that rarely do nature and history converge to reveal glimpses not only of the secrets of the snows, but of our unknown historic past. Nor are all of the mysteries solved; we are left still wondering, still blessed with the gift of the unknown. There are deep mysteries wafting in the breezes of both polar ice and mind. Readers will revisit the rich history of early explorations and follow in the footsteps of the adventurers of our historic past. Seldom do science and history so ably complement each other.

## Review
One of the first things you read in this book is that if you don't like maps this book isn't for you, and I thought I like maps well enough. I mean maps are very cool! I would love to learn more about them. what I didn't realize is that this is true map nerdery. it's not just that there are maps, you get to learn where the maps were found, who made the maps, the philosophy behind the maps, other map nerds that the author talked to in their journey looking for maps, and more! I wasn't obsessed with maps before, but I am now. 

this book is about Antarctica, but what it's really about is maps of Antarctica. I know that sounds boring but it's actually quite an interesting and poetic history of the world and human exploration.

## Quotes

> My penchant for travel took me to amazing places as a young man, almost always solo, always in search of something new, in quest of answers and new adventure. I am glad, of course, that I did so when I was young and strong—if often uninformed. Today I wouldn’t think of it, stepping blithely into the predatory vast unknown. (Location 70)

> Transantarctic Mountains at its western margin. The peaks and parapets of the range which divides the continent into East and West Antarctica extends to the South Pole, then continues to the Antarctic Peninsula, and emerges north of the Straits of Magellan as the Andes Mountains of South America. The longest continual range of mountains on the planet, this range continues across Central America, then North America as the Rocky Mountains, and eventually the mountains of Alaska. Geology has thus connected Antarctica to the Arctic." (Location 301)

> It was apparent that Antarctica was not a stagnant continent locked forever in unyielding ice. It was and is a dynamic and ever-changing world responding yearly and by centuries to the inclinations of a constantly changing geologic and climatic earth. (Location 405)

> Most old maps of the world, much less of Antarctica, are questionable representations, constructed from brief landfalls, sightings made by unknown adventurers, collections of disparate pieces of the much larger puzzle, from the maps of other map makers, or from uninformed speculations. (Location 594)

> "One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time." —Andre Gide (Location 631)

> The earliest map known from human literature is that of the Babylonians some 5000 years ago. (Location 643)

> Not only did the Babylonians conceive of Earth as round, they were the first to conceive of a universe. The first to divide the circle of the sky into 360 degrees, degrees into minutes, and minutes into seconds, they also divided the day into hours, the hours into minutes, and the minutes into seconds. If we believed that our very ancient predecessors were primitive or ignorant, we are clearly wrong. (Location 649)

> while none of these scholars had available sufficient knowledge to extend the geography of the world beyond the region of the Mediterranean to Antarctica, the concept of a southern continent had emerged from Greek intellectual thought, a product of the belief in the need for geographic equilibrium, symmetry and balance. (Location 670)

> Our human history bulges with events of challenge and discovery of which we know nothing, and likely never will. These predecessors either left no record or, if they did, it was lost in the embers at Alexandria or the flames of ignorance at repositories in other ancient lands. Our human history is immensely more expansive and mysterious than we shall ever know, exciting and forever beckoning, we can hardly let it go. (Location 955)

> the “inertia” that often accompanies environmental change. Variations in climate, trends in atmospheric circulation, and modifications of ocean currents may occur tens or even hundreds of years after the forces that have caused them. (Location 1506)

> The absence of a record does not, once again, require the absence of a history. (Location 1781)

## Notes while reading

### Has Antarctica always been cold?
No, in the Cretaceous period (100 million years ago), Antarctica was much warmer and home to forests and dinosaurs. Fossils beneath the ice reveal parts of the continent once had a temperate, swampy climate. 90 million years ago, there was a lush rainforest near the South Pole.

The continent began to cool around 34 mil years ago, coinciding with the separation of South America and Australia which allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form. This isolated Antarctica and trapped it in a refrigerated state. Ice sheets formed permanently and expanded to what we see today.

### What was discovered before the "Age of Discovery" and how is the "Age of Discovery" defined? (Is it central to western history while disregarding other explorers previous to that?)

Usually the "Age of Discovery" refers to 1400-1600 CE when European powers launched major maritime expeditions. This period opened European access to the Americas, Africa's coasts, and Asia's trade routes. 

It is a Eurocentric history, highlighting European expansion while minimizing (or ignoring) others, framing continents as "discovered" despite already being inhabited, and often taught as a triumph of European ingenuity. History of the Age of Exploration often downplays the slavery, colonization, and violence.

Modern scholar argue usage of terms like "Age of Colonial Expansion" or "Age of European Invasions" to more accurately reflect the consequences to non-Europeans and the Indigenous peoples.
