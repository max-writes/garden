## Summary
The book describes van der Kolk's research and experiences on how people are affected by traumatic stress, including its effects on the mind and body.
## Review
Before I get started, at some point halfway through this tome I started hearing "let the body keep the score" to the tune of "let the bodies hit the floor" from the song "Bodies" by Drowning Pool (2001) and this impacted what otherwise may have been a less musical read.

This was difficult to get through, not only because it is 358 pages of tiny print, but also because it is very medical. I cannot believe they shelve this in self-help and read it for book club. Amazing. 

It's the first research psychology book I've read since 2006 and it came at a good time for me. I initially started reading because I have trauma and I was ready to face something difficult about it, but it actually showed me how much strength and resilience I've built over my life. I came out of this read proud of myself. I furiously underlined and starred things that reminded me of myself, taking the time here and there to meditate on why I underlined and starred those things and how it made me feel to read those words. Reading this was a kind of therapy in itself.

I know there has been a lot of updated knowledge since this was written but I'm still noting the exercises and techniques described throughout the book that resonated with me. A lot of this reminded me of others I know who have experienced trauma (I'll probably be quick to recommend it if it comes up). 

Looking forward to a re-read in 10-15 years when I have more perspective on what I've learned and how I'll grow between now and then.
