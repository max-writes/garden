# Antarctica 
The term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle, was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD, and was named so when it was believed to exist. The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that it was a continent. 

The first landing on the continent was likely in the mid 1800s, and the "Heroic Age of Arctic Exploration" followed at the end of the 19th century.

## About 
- **Size**: 14 million km² (5th largest continent)
- **Population**: ~1,000–5,000 (seasonal, all researchers)
- **Number of Countries**: 0 (governed by Antarctic Treaty System)
- **Major Languages**: None official
- **Notable Features**: South Pole, polar plateau, ice shelves, katabatic winds
- **Biodiversity**: Penguins, seals, krill, whales, cold-adapted microbes
- **Economy**: No permanent economy; research and limited tourism only
- **Trivia**: Antarctica is technically a desert (least precipitation), and some parts have not seen rain or snow in over 2 million years.

### Has Antarctica always been cold?
No, in the Cretaceous period (100 million years ago), Antarctica was much warmer and home to forests and dinosaurs. Fossils beneath the ice reveal parts of the continent once had a temperate, swampy climate. 90 million years ago, there was a lush rainforest near the South Pole.

The continent began to cool around 34 mil years ago, coinciding with the separation of South America and Australia which allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form. This isolated Antarctica and trapped it in a refrigerated state. Ice sheets formed permanently and expanded to what we see today.
