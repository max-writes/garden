### vs Other
fromÂ *The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity* by Julia Cameron (published in 1992, reprinted in 2002)

> Many of us find that we have squandered our own creative energies by investing disproportionately in the lives, hopes, dreams, and plans of others. Their lives have obscured and detoured our own. As we consolidate a core through our withdrawal process, we become more able to articulate our own boundaries, dreams, and authentic goals. Our personal flexibility increases while our malleability to the whims of others decreases. We experience a heightened sense of autonomy and possibility.  (31)
