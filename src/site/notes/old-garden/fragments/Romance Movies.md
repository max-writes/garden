# Romance Movies
What some may call a "guilty pleasure" I call "a total love and appreciation for low budget, usually low-rated movies." I love the Hallmark, low budget, fantasy romance movies for many of the same reasons why I like B horror and backyard films. The effects are not as good or artistic (or gruesome) but there is a similar charm in the scripting, dialogue, character development, and twists. 

This page doesn't only include typically low-rated movies, but it does include a lot of them and I don't differentiate. My ratings are based on my personal feelings, whether I liked a movie or not, not based on critical reception. 

Originally I wanted a long list of seasonal / themed romance and [[old-garden/fragments/Horror Movies\|horror movies]] so I can have a group of reliably good movies to rewatch and love all year, but this page may evolve into multiple categories.
