### Writing visibly

from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> In the act of public writing, we expose our ideas and begin to understand our own thoughts more clearly.

### Storytelling
from _Learning with E’s: Educational Theory and Practice in the Digital Age_ by Steve Wheeler (published in 2015)

> Whatever the format of the story, whether related as an oral presentation, a blockbuster movie, or even a bestselling novel, storytelling has the function of reinforcing societal norms, and tracing the history of who we are, our collective identity, the very essence of our humanity.
