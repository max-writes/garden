## Flights

### OMA to PHX

5 year old boy on the plane: "I have two besties, one is Brody and I don't know the other one's name"

### PHX to HOU
flight attendant: 
- "we don't trust you to follow directions so we're going to walk by and make sure your seatbelt is fastened"
- "if the masks drop stop screaming you're wasting oxygen"
- "if you are going to leave anything behind please make sure it's extremely valuable"

child: "I am not a jet! I am a human."
