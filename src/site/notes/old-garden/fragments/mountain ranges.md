#notes/knowledge 
# Mountain ranges
I caught myself earlier sitting on the couch with my cat thinking about Antarctic mountain ranges, something I knew basically nothing about before a few days ago. I've been reading [[old-garden/fragments/library/Of Maps and Men\|this book]] about Antarctica which I picked up in my journey to read more about the globe and continents that I don't know anything about, and the author talks about their journey through Antarctica with a group of scientists and explorers.

The thing is, keeping this knowledge management thing always makes me feel like I'm a little behind. Writing it down and capturing the knowledge is never as fast as learning. I don't expect it to be, and I don't want to imply that this is something that's causing me distress, but it is something that I think about. 

But there I was on the couch thinking about icy landscapes and imagining the photography from the book that I've seen so far. I thought about the maps. I thought about being in the snow in a foreign place not yet fully seen by humans. I thought about how thinking about mountain ranges is a fantastic way to honor the knowledge I've gained. 

It takes time to write things down and that's fine. I would still like to appreciate that I'm learning and I know more now than I did last year, and that I have all of these new thoughts in my brain that I never would have had if I hadn't started reading again.

So, it's okay that I'll never be caught up. This system will always be behind. But in the meantime, I can think about mountain ranges I didn't know about a week ago and sink in the knowledge that I'm gaining about this world.
