# Writer Mission Statement 

## Writer Mission Statement 7/25/25
I write to make knowledge usable.

My mission is to bridge the gap between complex systems and the people who use or support them. I create and maintain documentation that enables cross-functional teams to achieve their goals, from technical support staff assisting designers, to academic professionals adapting to evolving classroom tools and processes. Whether I’m leading documentation strategy, shaping release communications, or maintaining internal standards, I focus on delivering clarity and consistency at scale. 

**Clarity:** I prioritize clear, user-centered language that reduces ambiguity and supports  understanding.

**Purposeful communication:** I focus on helping users do something with the knowledge they’ve gained, whether that’s resolving an issue, making a decision, or supporting others.

**Audience awareness:** I write with an understanding of varied audiences: frontline support teams, subject matter experts, academic professionals, and cross-departmental collaborators. Each has different needs, and my writing adapts accordingly.

**Sustainability:** I champion processes and structures that make documentation maintainable over time. I write with the future in mind, supporting long-term knowledge transfer and ease of updates.

**Collaboration:** Documentation is most powerful when ownership is shared. I create frameworks that encourage contribution and co-ownership across roles.

**Curiosity and continuous learning:** I approach documentation as a dynamic process and stay curious about tools, techniques, and evolving user needs. I am always looking for ways to improve how knowledge is shared and used.

## Writer Mission Statement 8/8/24

I write to provide others with foundational knowledge of processes and platforms involved in their work so that they can link concepts faster than they might have independently, and so guide users have a shared knowledge source for best practices and how-to information.

**Core Values**

- Integrity
- Accuracy
- User-centered
- Consistency (styling, formatting, voice)
- Knowledge sharing

I like writing everything! I have opportunities to write different types of documents in my current position, but my favorite writing is focused on software instructions and process that a non-technical person might require to complete their job duties. This often includes:

1. how the technology is supposed to work towards their individual goals/use cases,
2. the intersection between operations and technical process (what is a technical limitation vs business decision),
3. instructions for using customizations, and
4. guidance via troubleshooting scenarios.
