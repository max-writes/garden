# I want to write

I want to write professionally. I want to write for work.

Unfortunately, it seems like the way to “build your presence” and “get visibility” is to write like this.

✅ One line per 2-3 sentences  
✅ Emojis to help illustrate quick points  
✅ Less than 500 words, probably  
✅ To the point and no BS (this is good in any writing)

I don’t hate this, but I hate this. I can write like this, but reading this? I hate this.

❓ How can I devolve into writing in a format I hate reading just to get a job?  
⁉ How could I possibly put something like this in my portfolio and honestly present it as my best work?

If this is the expectation, I will sit this one out.

It’s good that we are thinking of reading on the web/mobile devices, and how to make the information easier to digest, but this “bite size” 🍪 emoji 😀 picture book 📖 approach isn’t it.

This isn’t even how people use emojis in conversation 💬, so how has this become the standard for presenting ideas on the web?

If I can’t think of a better way to write my ideas, I will wait for the next trend 📈 to join in on the fun.
