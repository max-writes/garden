# Intro to AI Class

I finished the [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence) course on LinkedIn. It was a quick 1.5 hours of learning to introduce concepts I need to know for my next big project.

This is a great beginners course if you know a bit about how AI works, but want to understand more. It provides an overview of terminology and concepts with clear examples and nice graphics as visual examples.

For intermediate learners: This does not teach you how to build or work in AI systems, though may be useful to provide supplemental information for your studies if you need more background.  
  
I took this course as an intro so I can move forward with learning how to get my reins on AI to analyze and find patterns in documentation (and, personally, my journal entries). I found this to be a fantastic starting point. The explanations have me already thinking of the types of learning I might use in my work. However, it certainly won’t get you to your goal if you plan to build something.

I used the LinkedIn Learning app for the first time to watch this, and it was so buggy that I had to watch almost the entire course twice just to get my profile badge and certificate. Being mostly new concepts to me, this helped reinforce the knowledge, so while I’m not sure I recommend watching it twice, it could help to rewatch earlier videos once you complete the course. This brings all the connections together nicely.
