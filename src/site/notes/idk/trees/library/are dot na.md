# 1 year with are.na

https://www.are.na/max-bones/channels
- Premium account for less limits
- Joined Nov 2022, started paying in Dec 2023 after using it for 1 year casually and running out of blocks

## Process
* **History**: Use are.na to capture seasonal moods. As I saw people were posting a lot about technology in different ways, I created the "intersections" channel to collect the ones that made me think, laugh, or have some other feeling. When I got premium I started using it for more focused ideas like collecting info on a certain topic.
* **Browsing**: I just open, go to the Explore page, browse until I get bored.
* **Bookmarking**: If I come across something that fits one of my buckets, I bookmark it here rather than any other location in my PKMS. 
* **Adding channels**: 
	* Lots in the "idk" channel that makes sense to make a channel
	* Target/topic I am researching or collecting information about
* **Frequency**: For the most part I use are.na a little bit here and there. This is where I go if I feel I need to "scroll to zone out" (rather than doom scrolling). This is because usually I find something that sparks an idea/thought and I'm inspired to get off my phone. I'm a fairly casual user and I'm not sure I use this platform to its fullest potential. I am into it more to track my own reflections and patterns, rather than to collab with others.

## Channels
- **intersections**: Digital technologies, human-computer interaction, and related items. These come from within are.na (browsing the Explore page) and myself (reflections & photos).
- Seasons: I add items to these buckets during the season only - in that moment, the item was very "season *mood*" for whatever reason. These come from within are.na and myself. (**winter**, **spring**, **summer**, **fall**)
- **digital library**: PDFs and ebooks
- Topics: These come from within are.na and myself.
	- **digitalgarden**: Collection of links and inspiration for my Obsidian digital garden setup and approach.
	- **pandemic reflections**: Trying to capture what I learned during the pandemic, or thoughts I have now in reflection about it. I didn't keep good journals during that time and I want to get most of it caught before I start to forget what I learned from nearly 3 years of isolation.
- **idk**: I don't feel these fit in any of the above categories but I also don't want to make a new one just for any of these items (yet). This is a misc channel and almost all of them come from within are.na.
