# Living Seasons
I started timing my life through seasons during the pandemic, preferring a 3.5 month structure over 365 days. This page provides a brief overview of some of the practices I've adopted (and some abandoned) while trying to figure out what works for me. 

The most wonderful thing I've learned from keeping these exercises is that seasons don't have much to do with the weather or color palette. Previously, my view of "seasons" was very limited to background knowledge and I wasn't often being intentional in my observation of the world. I now see and understand more about the cycles and patterns throughout the year, and instead of 4 separate seasons, time flows fluidly into the next micro-season from the last, and at all moments we are in a transition period.

## Seasonal Observation Projects (2022 - 2023)
In 2022 I started a seasonal project where I intentionally tracked my life and reactions to each season and shared my reflections with a handful of friends and family. It was a lot of fun sharing those observations. By watching the movement of seasons, I’ve gained some interesting insights. The project lasted from Winter to Fall and each season ended with a reflection letter and little art project of some kind. I enjoyed it but it was a lot of energy and required me to be in the mood to write, reflect, and be creative within a reasonable time after each season ended.

I’m sure that going forward I’ll still find ways to share the seasons with my people, but it will be more fun to do it DURING the season, not weeks into the next one!

The project had a bunch of different branches, some of which died early year, others continued and will be evolving into something else during the next set of seasons.
### Seasons Tracker spreadsheet
I purchased this [habit tracker spreadsheet](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1135650855/2022-2023-habit-tracker-spreadsheet?ref=yr_purchases) from [youareloved](https://youarelovedtemplates.com/) and modified it from a yearly tracker to a seasonal one. Other than the timeline modification and some category updates, I mostly stuck to the rest of the format offered in the original file.

1. I grouped yearly goals into a few categories: Reflection & Development, Home & Finances, Learning, Creativity, Social Balance
    - Yearly goals changed throughout the year, so my spreadsheet isn’t entirely dynamic. In retrospect I should have had yearly categories & seasonal goals, rather than expecting myself to benefit from the same goals all year.
    - Some of the goals I found fruitful to track and will continue monitoring in the new year, but keeping 2-3 goals per category was overwhelming: there were too many categories/goals to keep track of. In the future, I’ll limit myself to 5-7 goals total across the categories.

2. Each season had a page with areas for:    
	- **(A) Weekly habits** (7-10 habits tracked per week) – in the original template, these are daily, so I did some modification here to account for weeks per season. My weekly habit items were life maintenance tasks that I have difficulty getting to when I’m medium-low energy.
	- **(B) Accomplishments** (per month, a list of achievements and stuff that made me smile) – in the original template, these are weekly habits. Freewriting area to list stuff.
	- A short **(C) checklist** to accomplish by the end of the season – in the original template, these were monthly habits. This was put here to remind me to do my budget, reflect ahead of seasonal letters, etc.
    - **(D) Yearly goals** (per month, check which goals I completed) – this was included in the original template – I updated the category names though
	- **(E) Helpful links out** to other seasonal review items: Budget tracker which began in August, seasonal review doc where I was keeping notes for my mail project, home maintenance review, etc.

**Recommendations and reflection**

If you're interested in this kind of system, I highly recommend downloading a spreadsheet someone else already made and then updating it to your needs, if you don’t have the time or energy to create something from scratch. You're going to need to learn lots about formulas to get what you need so it's nice to have someone do most of the foundational structure for you. 

Having this spreadsheet system in 2022 really helped me get my life back on track after suffering severe burnout and depression for a few years. The system relies on myself reviewing the checklist at least once a week and actually doing something on it (or checking it off if I already have). Looking back at 2022, I did at least one thing every week, even during my lowest energy time periods. I'm being vulnerable to share the goals, but in making this page I can see how far I've come. I don't need to remind myself to go grocery shopping anymore, for example.

For the 2023 seasons, I moved my tracking system from only-Google to Notion and seasonal art journal. My Notion setup had several areas for budgeting, season review, tracking goals/habits, etc., and the seasonal art journal was flexible in what it could contain – bullet-journal like pages tracking spend/no-spend days, reminders/aids, mixed media expression of the season, etc.

Though I was formatting and using different tools than I was in 2022, a lot of the foundational logic came from the spreadsheet system. It was interesting seeing how my tracking evolves and builds on itself, though in different formats and paths. Unfortunately, I don't have screencaps of any of the 2023 stuff, which is why it doesn't get its own section.
### Season craft
My thought behind a seasonal craft was that I’d send it with my letters at the end of every season with something I made inside. It might be a print showing a picture of something I made (rather than the actual thing), but however it was delivered, it was shared. 

At the start of all this, in Winter 2021-22, I sent a mothman postcard.

![Living Seasons-1757286837040.png](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/Living%20Seasons-1757286837040.png)

*TBD - I'll need to dig up my letters to reveal what I made and sent the rest of the year.*

I started a seasonal art journal so I could continue with trying to express the seasons on the page in different ways. In 2022 I mostly explored through seasonal color palettes via doodles, but I was always frustrated I didn’t have one central location to go and journal about that. I bought a new journal as soon as I had that thought!

My “season craft” turned into more of a general “seasonal creative reflection.” In 2022, I got such good feedback from all my friends who said that my letters and crafts made them think more about the seasons too!

Unfortunately in 2023 I had a bit of a burnout again from doing too much (this can be a pitfall of life tracking), so I stopped sharing my observations of the seasons with people. 
### Season letter
I loved the idea of doing a seasonal reflective letter and sending it to a few people in my life. It was a way to get me out of the house (so I can really immerse myself in the world during that season), pay attention to my surroundings, proactively engage in the environment, and find time to reflect on observations in a concrete, meaningful way that could be shared with other people. 

I have to admit, I didn’t have high hopes for myself finishing since year-long projects aren’t usually my thing, but I’m proud to say I successfully sent all 4 letters!
### Season cryptid
I had such high hopes for this one, but in the end it wasn’t sustainable with everything else I had going on. The idea was to “adopt” a cryptid every season, go to an East Coast (easy to drive to) cryptozoology museum featuring artifacts from that cryptid, make a craft and otherwise immerse myself in that creature all season. I did really well with winter & spring but once summer came, I was too exhausted to give attention to such things.

- Winter – Mothman, went to the Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant, WV., made mothman papercrafts, watched lots of mothman media. Sent the mothman postcard I shared above.
- Spring – Sasquatch, went to a Cryptozoology Museum in Littleton, NC., got Benny the big Squishmallow sasquatch, watched lots of sasquatch media.
- Summer – Flatwoods Monster, planned a trip but didn’t go, planned art but ran out of energy.

I really enjoyed this idea, though. Who knows when I will randomly need to love on a cryptid all season? Now I have a nice little fallback for that.
### Season reflection
In my season reflection, I listed all the stuff I did or meaningful things that happened, as much as I could recall on the day I’m catching up (I tried to catch up 2-3 times a season to keep it fresh). This is also where I reflected on my thoughts about nature, like how the weather’s been, what the world looks like/color palettes, whatever other seasonal observations I’ve made.

This originally began as a personal note (12/30/22).

## Seasonal Engagement Projects (Fall 2024 - Summer 2025)
In 2023, I carried most of the same patterns as above, though I had a hard time sticking to it due to other life stresses. I converted my Notion system into icon-based and checkmark-driven app tracking (I tried a few different apps until I landed on Daylio and Finch), setting up goals that repeated for me and that were easy to change. The spreadsheet and Notion systems were helpful, but way too much effort. If I was going to keep up with it long-term, it needed to have minimal to no setup each month/season/year.

After focusing mostly on observation, I decided I needed to get more into actual engagement. It's one thing to recognize that each season has its own set of holidays, it's another one to force myself to learn about the holidays and in some cases celebrate new ones.
### Bingo
Before each season starts I make a bingo page for that season. I started this in Fall 2024 and it's no surprise I got SEVERAL bingos that season (it tends to be my most active/social season anyway). For Winter 24-25, I only got one bingo, but it was wonderful to even get that much, since I tend not to do anything during winter (as my hibernation months). The bingo card not only has me doing more than I might have, but it is also a useful tool to help observe my patterns in energy levels throughout the years.

**Fall Bingo (finished)**
![20241201_115018~3.jpg](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/20241201_115018~3.jpg)

To create a bingo card, I first draft up a 4x4 square (not 5x5, no free spaces intentionally!). Separately, I make a list of 16 seasonal things encompassing holidays, moods, creativity, education, or seasonal themes. This page is actually quite small (about 4x5 inches) so each of the boxes won't contain the full prompt, but rather a word or two and an image to represent it.

**Winter Bingo (fresh vs finished)**
![20241204_211648~3.jpg](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/20241204_211648~3.jpg)

Once I complete each item, I color in the box. If I had just done ANYTHING for Chinese New Year this year, I could have had two bingos! And clearly, I didn't spend much time in the kitchen.

![20250306_220043~2 1.jpg](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/20250306_220043~2%201.jpg)

**Spring Bingo (fresh)**
![idk/trees/attachments/20250322_170427~2.jpg](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/20250322_170427~2.jpg)

I drop the bingo card into a journal dedicated to that season. 
- Each time I finish an item, I color in the bingo square and make an entry in the journal explaining what I did and my thoughts about it. Sometimes I add pictures or artifacts from the experience. 
- For fall when I made a bingo, I'd make a post on my Instagram what I did (including photos).
- By the time winter bingo came around, I had deleted my Instagram. The plan was to make a blog post with the same but I did not do that... partially because I forgot to take photos of each activity, not being so "social media minded."
- Sometimes I make a post in the seasonal journal I added to my digital garden to support seasonal reflective practice in a MUCH easier way than coding it manually on my website. You can see entries in the #diary-bingo tag.

**Summer Bingo (fresh)**

![Living Seasons-1750898730905.jpg](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/Living%20Seasons-1750898730905.jpg)

I now have a physical journal for each season so even if I don't continue this bingo activity I'll have a space for my next round of seasonal reflection!
### are.na
I keep an are.na channel for each season and have been doing this since 2022. I only add to the seasonal channels during that season, and it includes posts found on are.na that evoke (to me) that season's meaning or mood. Sometimes I add original thoughts/photos, but these mostly encompass what I found from others.

- Winter: https://www.are.na/max-bones/winter-hweunc_r61o
- Spring: https://www.are.na/max-bones/spring-bod1qgjv9ue
- Summer: https://www.are.na/max-bones/summer-7dg_pvd6qro
- Fall: https://www.are.na/max-bones/fall-no5hffccdd8

I've found this to be an interesting way to reflect on how images can "feel like seasons" whether they are naturey or not. When I got to a point where I had been doing it for over a year (revisiting the winter album during winter 24-25) it was enlightening to see what felt like winter a year ago, and how much it still did. I had the same feeling into the next seasons so I plan to hold onto this for a while.
### Obsidian setup
To help with my seasonal reflection and keeping track of everything, I have a base set up each season in Obsidian to support note taking and checklists.

There is a folder for each season that begins with the following:
- "This week"
	- I use obsidian's "daily notes" feature for thoughts and feelings type of journaling, but I also keep a file that encompasses notes, bookmarks, or other random stuff I collect each week.
	- The file has all weeks for that season (12 weeks roughly) and provides a good location for me to review for when I write my monthly wrap ups or seasonal zines. 
- To do
	- Instead of daily, weekly, or monthly, I keep a seasonal to do list. This is not like the seasons tracker spreadsheet explained below. Instead, I divide my list into home, self, creativity, 101 things (goals list), and seasons. 
	- The seasons bucket includes stuff like my seasonal zine, bingo, preparing for the next season, setup, etc. Everything else are normal everyday goals and the things I do to keep my life moving.
- Weeknotes
	- Similar to the "this week" file, but focused entirely on work stuff. 
	- I used to keep this in Google drive, but in my journey to de-google, I moved it to Obsidian at the end of winter '25.
	- This is where I do all my complaining and reflecting privately. I usually keep notes once a month but I'm seeing value in perhaps increasing that frequency.

![Pasted image 20250316172829.png](/img/user/idk/trees/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250316172829.png)

This lives in my personal/private area (it doesn't publish to the digital garden). 

By the end of the season I end up with a note reviewing each month and another one to help draft my seasonal zine.
### Seasonal Zine
One of my 101 Things in 1,001 Days goals is to create a zine each season for a year. 

* Winter zine (2024-25)
	* reflection on the season
		* what happened in my life and what I was thinking/feeling all season
		* printed images from my winter are.na channel (read above for more info)
		* winter microseasons in the DC area
		* winter free write / word association
	* quotes and sayings
	* what was in my winter bingo and the bingos I got
	* review of the book *Wintering* by Katherine May
	* projects/creative things I did during winter
* Spring zine (2025)
	* I made this so late that I had already lost the joy and feeling of the season - it's alright, but it falls somewhat flat
	* I combined my Spring & Summer zines into a "hot months" zine. 
* Summer zine (2025)

Although I'll meet the goal after fall, I don't think this project is done with me yet.

## Fall 2025 on?
As the BINGO project comes to an end, I find myself with a bunch of new traditions and activities to do each season without 'challenging' myself into it. 

What's next as we move on through the seasons? I'll come back and update once I find out!

For now, I am planning for...
- Continuing the seasonal zine, which didn't pick up until I found a solution for printing online. If I'm printing at home, I don't have the energy to make as many as I want to share, so it posed a difficulty until I explored my options and found some things to try.
- Continuing the concept of keeping seasonal journals, but instead of Bing, I'll be journaling the activities from [[Down to the River and Up to the Trees\|Down to the River and Up to the Trees]], which I've categorized and divided by season.
- Continue building and reviewing the seasonal are.na channels which provide an interesting angle of seasonal interpretation. 
- Learning more about the science behind seasons while I appreciate it LIVE and IN ACTION.
- Finding another creative way to share my findings with people!
